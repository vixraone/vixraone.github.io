<div class='title'>A Constructive Proof and Algorithm for the 2D Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem with Surjective Mapping</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ruohan_yang">Ruohan Yang</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This article investigates the two-dimensional Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem within the context of a surjective continuous transformation function ( f(x) ). This function can be interpreted as defining a continuous vector field. In this framework, each point in the disk is mapped to another point via a specific vector associated with the continuous transformation, thereby establishing a coherent vector field. This function can be interpreted as defining a continuous vector field. In this framework, the vector field can be decomposed two vector fields. Instead of&#160; proving the existence of fixed point directly, the article aim to focus on prove the vector fields always has intersection where at this point, the vector fields has opposite directiond and same norm.The paper also provide the programming experiment which further verifies the proof.</div>

<div class='title'>A Generalized Contructive Proof for Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem on D^2 and D^3</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ruohan_yang">Ruohan Yang</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This article present a constructive proof by analyzing decompositions of continuous vector field. The original proof of Brouwer's theorem relies on a contradiction argument, which, while effective, does not offer a constructive method for locating the fixed point. Through projecting arbitrary vector field the basis of the vector field, it can be proved there exists zero points on both of the basis. The article will also generalize the proof from 2D to 3D dimensions. The method is also valid under surjective and scaling map.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ryan_j_buchanan">Ryan J. Buchanan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Given a collection of sections of a principal fiber running from the base of a topological space to its top, can we recreate the entire topological space? We answer this question in the affirmative for symplectic manifolds,assuming we are given a filtration of weights. Using the weights which are representative generators at each local neighborhood about each section of a smooth fiber, we reduce our original problem to the Ricci-iterated mapping of Riemann surfaces along a geodesic.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alfonso_de_miguel_bueno">Alfonso De Miguel bueno</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This preprint introduces in a visual and conceptual way a model of two intersecting curved fields with a shared nucleus, whose quantized dynamics offer potential cases of the four-variable Jacobian conjecture and a nonlinear Hodge cycle. The Kummer type geometry of the model suggests a unified framework where abstract mathematical developments like Tomita-Takesaki, Gorenstein, and Dolbeault theories, can be conceptually linked to the Jacobian, Hodge, and Riemann conjectures. Other mathematical physics topics, like the mass gap problem, releflection positivity, the arise of an imaginary time, or t-duality are also described within this context. The model also lays the foundation of a novel deterministic quantum atomic system with a supersymmetric dual nucleus structure of matter and mirror antimatter.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This document is devoted to understanding and implementing the energy numbers, which were recently explicated very clearly by Emmerson in his recent paper. Through this line of reasoning, it becomes apparent that the algebra defined by the energy numbers are indeed the natural algebra for categorifying quantization. We also develop a notion of symmetric topological vector spaces, and forcing on said spaces motivated by homological mirror symmetry.</div>

<div class='title'>Stringy Motivic Spectra</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ryan_j_buchanan">Ryan J. Buchanan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We consider strings from the perspective of stable motivic, homotopical QFT. Some predictions for the behavior of gauginos in both a Minkowski light cone and $5$-dimensional $mathcal{A}dmathcal{S}_5$-space are given. We show that there is a duality between working locking in a system of dendrites, and threshold edging at the periphery of a manifold.This work extends the work of [4] and [7] by providing a more mathematical interpretation of the realization of quasi-quanta in open topological dynamical systems. This interpretation incidentally involves the category of pure motives over $mathfrak{C}$, and projections of fiber spectra to the category of stable homotopies.</div>

<div class='title'>Geometric Sub-Bundles</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ryan_j_buchanan">Ryan J. Buchanan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Let $mathfrak{X}$ be a topological stack, and $LocSys(mathfrak{X})$ a local system taking varieties $v in mathfrak{X}$ to their projective resolutions over an affine coordinate system. Let $alpha$ and $beta$ be smooth charts encompassing non-degenerate loci of the upper-half plane, and let $varphi$ be the map $beta circ alpha^{-1}$. Our goal is to describe a class of vector bundles, called $emph{geometric sub-bundles}$, which provide holonomic transport for n-cells (for small values of n) over a $G_delta$-space which models the passage $mathfrak{X} ightrightarrows LocSys(mathfrak{X})$. We will first establish the preliminary definitions before advancing our core idea, which succinctly states that for a pointed, stratified space $Strat_M^ast$, there is a canonical selection of transition maps $[varphi]$ which preserves the intersection of a countable number of fibers in some sub-bundle of the bundle $Bun_V$ over $LocSys(mathfrak{X})$</div>

<div class='abstract'>Safety is critical in robotic tasks. Energy function based methods have been introduced to address the problem. To ensure safety in the presence of control limits, we need to design an energy function that results in persistently feasible safe control at all system states.However, designing such an energy function for high-dimensional nonlinear systems remains challenging.Considering the fact that there are redundant dynamics in high dimensional systems with respect to the safety specifications, this paper proposes a novel approach called abstract safe control.We propose a system abstraction method that enables the design of energy functions on a low-dimensional model.Then we can synthesize the energy function with respect to the low-dimensional model to ensure persistent feasibility.The resulting safe controller can be directly transferred to other systems with the same abstraction, e.g., when a robot arm holds different tools. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a 7-DoF robot arm (14 states) both in simulation and real-world. Our method always finds feasible control and achieves zero safety violations in 500 trials on 5 different systems.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/sing_kuang_tan">Sing Kuang Tan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we developed a set of linear constraints to test whether 4 points form a square. Traditionally people use Euclidean distance to test whether the 4 points form a square. It forms a square if the four sides are of equal length and the diagonals are of equal length. My test function using a set of linear constraints is much simpler without the use of quadratic operations in Euclidean distance test function. This is needed in the future to prove Square Peg Problem for any arbitary closed curve.</div>

<div class='title'>A Theoretical Approach to Complex Systems Analysis: Simple Non-Directed Graphs as Homogenous, Morphological Models</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alexander_chang">Alexander Chang</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recent advances have begun to blur the lines between theoretical mathematics and applied mathematics. Oftentimes, in a variety of fields, concepts from not only applied mathematics but theoretical mathematics have been employed to great effect. As more and more researchers come to utilize, deploy, and develop both abstract and concrete mathematical models (both theoretical and applied), the demand for highly generalizable, accessible, and versatile mathematical models has increased drastically (Rosen, 2011). Specifically in the case of Complex Systems and the accompanying field of Complex Systems Analysis, this phenomenon has had profound effects. As researchers, academics, and scholars from these fields turn to mathematical models to assist in their scientific inquiries (specifically, concepts and ideas taken from various subsets of graph theory), the limitations of our current mathematical frameworks becomes increasingly apparent. To remedy this, we present the Chang Graph, a simple graph defined by an n-sided regular polygon surrounding a 2n-sided regular polygon. Various properties and applications of this graph are discussed, and further research is proposed for the study of this mathematical model.</div>

<div class='title'>Very Elementary Proof of Invariance of Domain for the Real Line</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/yu-lin_chou">Yu-Lin Chou</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>That every Euclidean subset homeomorphic to the ambient Euclidean space is open, a version of invariance of domain, is a relatively deep result whose typical proof is far from elementary. When it comes to the real line, the version of invariance of domain admits a simple proof that depends precisely on some elementary results of ``common sense''. It seems a pity that an elementary proof of the version of invariance of domain for the real line is not well-documented in the related literature even as an exercise, and it certainly deserves a space. Apart from the main purpose, as we develop the ideas we also make present some pedagogically enlightening remarks, which may or may not be well-documented.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We generalize the very well known boundary operator of the ordinary singular homology theory. We describe a variant of this ordinary simplicial boundary operator, where the usual boundary (n-1)-simplices of each n-simplex, i.e. the `faces&#180;, are replaced by combinations of internal (n-1)-simplices parallel to the faces. This construction may lead to an infinte class of extraordinary non-isomorphic homology theories. Further, we show some interesting constructions on the standard simplex.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Khalimsky topology plays a significant role in the digital image processing. In this paper we define a topology $\kappa_1$ on the set of integers generated by the triplets of the form $\{2n, 2n+1, 2n+3\}$. We show that in this space $(\mathbb{Z}, \kappa_1)$, every point has a smallest neighborhood and hence this is an Alexandroff space. This topology is homeomorphic to Khalimskt topology. We prove, among others, that this space is connected and $T_{3/4}$. Moreover, we introduce the concept of $^*g\hat{\alpha}$-closed sets in a topological space and characterize it using $^*g\alpha o$-kernel and closure. We investigate the properties of $^*g\hat{\alpha}$-closed sets in digital plane. The family of all $^*g\hat{\alpha}$-open sets of $(\mathbb{Z}^2, \kappa^2)$, forms an alternative topology of $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that this plane $(\mathbb{Z}^2, ^*g\hat{\alpha}O)$ is $T_{1/2}$. It is well known that the digital plane $(\mathbb{Z}^2, \kappa^2)$ is not $T_{1/2}$, even if $(\mathbb{Z}, \kappa)$ is $T_{1/2}$.</div>

The ``homeomorphic&quot; means that by non-singular deformation one produces perfect sphere - the equivalent of initial space. However, pasting in foreign caps will not make such deformation.

Finally I indicate how one might take these ideas further, in terms of constructing frameworks to study policies, which relate to the solution of various algebraic invariants.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/h_e_winkelnkemper">H.E. Winkelnkemper</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Using Artin Presentation Theory, we mathematically augment a remark of Atiyah on physics and Donaldson's 4D theory which, conversely, explicitly introduces the theoretical physical relevance of AP Theory into Modern Physics. AP Theory is a purely discrete group-theoretic, in fact, a framed pure braid theory, which, in the sharpest possible holographic manner, encodes all closed, orientable 3-manifolds and their knot and linking theories, and a large class of compact, connected, simply-connected, smooth 4-manifolds with a connected boundary, whose physical relevance for Atiyah's remark we explain.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/vincenzo_nardozza">Vincenzo Nardozza</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>By means of a computer, all the possible homogeneous compact generalised triangulations made up of a small number of 3-simplexes (from 1 to 3) have been classified in homology classes. The analysis shows that, with a small number of simplexes, it is already possible to build quite a large number of separate topological spaces.</div>

<div class='title'>Effective Dynamic Iso-Sphere Inopin Holographic Rings: Inquiry and Hypothesis</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/nathan_o_schmidt">Nathan O. Schmidt</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this preliminary work, we focus on a particular iso-geometrical, iso-topological facet of iso-mathematics by suggesting a developing, generalized approach for encoding the states and transitions of spherically-symmetric structures that vary in size. In particular, we introduce the notion of &quot;effective iso-radius&quot; to facilitate a heightened characterization of dynamic iso-sphere Inopin holographic rings (IHR) as they undergo &quot;iso-transitions&quot; between &quot;iso-states&quot;. In essence, we propose the existence of &quot;effective dynamic iso-sphere IHRs&quot;. In turn, this emergence drives the construction of a new &quot;effective iso-state&quot; platform to encode the generalized dynamics of such iso-complex, non-linear systems in a relatively straightforward approach of spherical-based iso-topic liftings. The initial results of this analysis are significant because they lead to alternative modes of research and application, and thereby pose the question: do these effective dynamic iso-sphere IHRs have application in physics and chemistry? Our hypothesis is: yes. To answer this inquiry and assess this conjecture, this developing work should be subjected to further scrutiny, collaboration, improvement, and hard work via the scientific method in order to advance it as such.</div>

<div class='title'>Exterior and Interior Dynamic Iso-Sphere Holographic Rings with an Inverse Iso-Duality</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/nathan_o_schmidt">Nathan O. Schmidt</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this preliminary work, we use a dynamic iso-unit function to iso-topically lift the &quot;static&quot; Inopin holographic ring (IHR) of the unit sphere to an interconnected pair of &quot;dynamic iso-sphere IHRs&quot; (iso-DIHR), where the IHR is simultaneously iso-dual to both a magnified &quot;exterior iso-DIHR&quot; and de-magnified ``interior iso-DIHR&quot;. For both the continuously-varying and discretely-varying cases, we define the dynamic iso-amplitude-radius of one iso-DIHR as being equivalent to the dynamic iso-amplitude-curvature of its counterpart, and conversely. These initial results support the hypothesis that a new IHR-based mode of iso-geometry and iso-topology may be in order, which is significant because the interior and exterior zones delineated by the IHR are fundamentally &quot;iso-dual inverses&quot; and may be inferred from one another.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/reza_katebi">Reza Katebi</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/nathan_o_schmidt">Nathan O. Schmidt</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this introductory work, we use Santilli's iso-topic lifting as a cutting-edge platform to explore Mandelbrot's set. The objective is to upgrade Mandelbrot's complex quadratic polynomial with iso-multiplication and then computationally probe the effects on this revolutionary fractal. For this, we define the &quot;iso-complex quadratic polynomial&quot; and engage it to generate a locally iso-morphic array of &quot;Mandelbrot iso-sets&quot; by varying the iso-unit, where the connectedness property is topologically preserved in each case. The iso-unit broadens and strengthens the chaotic analysis, and authorizes an enhanced classification and demystification such complex systems because it equips us with an additional degree of freedom: the new Mandelbrot iso-set array is an improvement over the traditional Mandelbrot set because it is significantly more general. In total, the experimental results exemplify dynamic iso-spaces and indicate two modes of topological effects: scale-deformation and boundary-deformation. Ultimately, these new and preliminary developments spark further insight into the emerging realm of iso-fractals.</div>

<div class='title'>Toward a Topological Iso-String Theory in 4D Iso-Dual Space-Time: Hypothesis and Preliminary Construction</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/nathan_o_schmidt">Nathan O. Schmidt</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We propose a preliminary framework that engages iso-triplex numbers and deformation order parameters to encode the spatial states of Iso Open Topological Strings (Iso-OTS) for fermions and the temporal states of Iso Closed Topological Strings (Iso-CTS) for bosons, where space and time are iso-dual. The objective is to introduce an elementary Topological Iso-String Theory (TIST) that complies with the holographic principle and fundamentally represents the twisting, winding, and deforming of helical, spiral, and vortical information structures---by default---for attacking superfluidic motion patterns and energy states with iso-topic lifting. In general, these preliminary results indicate a cutting-edge, flexible, consistent, and powerful iso-mathematical framework with considerable representational capability that warrants further examination, collaboration, construction, and discipline.</div>

<div class='title'>Dynamic Iso-Topic Lifting with Application to Fibonacci's Sequence and Mandelbrot's Set</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/nathan_o_schmidt">Nathan O. Schmidt</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this exploration, we introduce and define &quot;dynamic iso-spaces&quot;, which are cutting-edge iso-mathematical constructions that are built with &quot;dynamic iso-topic liftings&quot; for &quot;dynamic iso-unit functions&quot;. For this, we consider both the continuous and discrete cases. Subsequently, we engineer two simple examples that engage Fibonacci's sequence and Mandelbrot's set to define a &quot;Fibonacci dynamic iso-space&quot; and a &quot;Mandelbrot dynamic iso-space&quot;, respectively. In total, this array of resulting iso-structures indicates that a new branch of iso-mathematics may be in order.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Recently in 1997, Sarker in [8] introduced the concept of fuzzy ideal and fuzzy local function between fuzzy topological spaces. In the present paper, we introduce some new fuzzy notions via fuzzy ideals. Also, we generalize the notion of L-open sets due to Jankovic and Homlett [6]. In addition to, we generalize the concept of L-closed sets, L- continuity due to Abd El-Monsef et al. [2]. Relationships between the above new fuzzy notions and other relevant classes are investigated.1</div>

<div class='title'>Initiating Santilli's Iso-Mathematics to Triplex Numbers, Fractals, and Inopin's Holographic Ring: Preliminary Assessment and New Lemmas</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/nathan_o_schmidt">Nathan O. Schmidt</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/reza_katebi">Reza Katebi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In a preliminary assessment, we begin to apply Santilli's iso-mathematics to triplex numbers, Euclidean triplex space, triplex fractals, and Inopin's 2-sphere holographic ring (HR) topology. In doing so, we successfully identify and define iso-triplex numbers for iso-fractal geometry in a Euclidean iso-triplex space that is iso-metrically equipped with an iso-2-sphere HR topology. As a result, we state a series of lemmas that aim to characterize these emerging iso-mathematical structures. These initial outcomes indicate that it may be feasible to engage this encoding framework to systematically attack a broad range of problems in the disciplines of science and mathematics, but a thorough, rigorous, and collaborative investigation should be in order to challenge, refine, upgrade, and implement these ideas.</div>

<div class='title'>Funcoids and Reloids</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/victor_porton">Victor Porton</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is a part of my Algebraic General Topology research. In this article, I introduce the concepts of funcoids, which generalize proximity spaces and reloids, which generalize uniform spaces. The concept of funcoid is generalized concept of proximity, the concept of reloid is cleared from superfluous details (generalized) concept of uniformity. Also funcoids generalize pretopologies and preclosures. Also funcoids and reloids are generalizations of binary relations whose domains and ranges are filters (instead of sets). Also funcoids and reloids can be considered as a generalization of (oriented) graphs, this provides us with a common generalization of analysis and discrete mathematics. The concept of continuity is defined by an algebraic formula (instead of old messy epsilondelta notation) for arbitrarymorphisms (including funcoids and reloids) of a partially ordered category. In one formula are generalized continuity, proximity continuity, and uniform continuity.</div>
