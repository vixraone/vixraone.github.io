<div class='title'>From Straight Beams to Curved Paths: A Unified Perspective on Energy, Fields, and Spacetime</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/marco_maccarrone">Marco Maccarrone</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper proposes a conceptual and athematical framework that replaces the straight-line propagation of energy and fields, as traditionally assumed in quantum field theory (QFT), with a curved-wavefront perspective that aligns with the geometry of spacetime in general relativity (GR). By redefining straight beams as curved paths where the length of any beam equals the radius of a spherical wave-front at a given instant we achieve a unified description of energy propagation, reconciling wave-particle duality with spacetime curvature. This approachresolves inconsistencies between QFT and GR, offering a new lens for understanding phenomena like redshift, gravitational lensing, and wave-particle interactions in curved spacetime.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jan_srowig">Jan Srowig</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This hypothesis views the universe as a dynamic structure that was formed not by a single, all-encompassing Big Bang, but through several independent cosmic energy bursts cite{penrose2010cycles, steinhardt2002colliding}. Such events could have occurred over very long periods in various regions of a possibly unbounded cosmic space, where universes expand freely without separating membranes or isolating structures. The aim of this hypothesis is not to challenge the Big Bang theory but to broaden it with a more comprehensive perspective. While the classical Big Bang theory provides us with the image of a singular origin, this hypothesis suggests that various cosmic events may have contributed jointly to the formation and structuring of the universe.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/manuel_uruena_palomo">Manuel Uruena Palomo</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The value of the gravitational wave energy density is unknown. Current progress in gravitational wave detection suggests that the energy density of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) will be estimated in the next decades. We present a derivation of its value under the assumption that energy lost due to cosmic redshift is fully responsible for the energy gained by the cosmological constant in the expanding universe. This unknown non-local mechanism of energy conservation on the cosmic scale could explain dark energy and hint at a property of a theory of quantum gravity.</div>

<div class='title'>On Regular Negative Mass Black Holes Under Unitary Time and Proper Antichronous Transformations</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/manuel_uruena_palomo">Manuel Uruena Palomo</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A non-singular black hole solution is briefly presented which violates energy conditions only at its interior by postulating a consistent shift to negative energies and gravitationally repulsive negative masses at the event horizon. This shift is the unitary parity-time $PT$ transformation of relativistic quantum mechanics and the proper antichronous transformation of the full Lorentz group. The transformation at the event horizon respects Einstein's equivalence principle, and the considered negative mass interaction does not result in the runaway motion paradox or vacuum instability. The correspondence of these regular black holes with observed ones is studied by proposing another mechanism of black hole growth independent of accretion and merging due to interior increasing entropy, which attempts to solve the unexplained size and formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes, the intermediate mass gap, and the information paradox.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The most popular approach of understanding the cosmic evolution is Einstein&#8217;s General Relativity(GR). GR is the classical gateway to obtain the dynamics of the cosmic fluid and it canat best describe the macroscopic evolution of the Universe. In this work, we have accomplishedan alternative tool to examine the microscopic dynamics of the cosmic fluid particles via quantumfield theory (QFT). We have proposed a cosmic fluid model with complex scalar field Lagrangiancorresponding to the modified Klein-Gordon equation (KG equation) of the scalar field in FLRWspace-time. Following this Lagrangian, the cosmic fluid system has been quantized under certainrestrictions on the parameters. This restrictions are used to determine the cosmic evolution patternin the macroscopic level.</div>

<div class='title'>Is Modern Physics Moving Towards Metaphysics?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/tadeusz_pastuszek">Tadeusz Pastuszek</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The increasing incorporation of speculative constructs such as dark matter, the Higgs field, and cosmic inflation within modern physics indicates a shift towards metaphysical frameworks, potentially compromising the empirical rigor traditionally upheld in physical sciences. This article critically evaluates the foundational paradigms in quantum mechanics and cosmology, asserting that constructs like the Big Bang theory and baryogenesis introduce elements that lack experimental validation and challenge established physical principles. By examining the epistemic and methodological implications of these paradigms, the author argues that theoretical physics must resist the encroachment of metaphysical assumptions and prioritize models grounded in measurable, observable phenomena. The article proposes a recalibration of the discipline, advocating for a return to empirically verifiable principles and logically cohesive theories that align with classical physics. Through this approach, theauthor suggests, physics can maintain its empirical integrity, ensuring that theoretical advancements remain anchored in experimentally testable reality and do not drift into speculative abstraction.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The article presents a relativistic extension of Newton's second law of motion, adapted to a four-dimensional spacetime construct where time and space are treated under the framework of special relativity. By introducing a unique concept of"U-space", where time functions as a spatial coordinate with its own metric pro-perties, the study explores Newtonian dynamics through a relativistic lens. Thisexploration includes the derivation of relativistic force and acceleration equations,considering both constant and variable rest mass scenarios. The derived formulations, based on the principles of special relativity, are presented with modications that incorporate mass-energy equivalence, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of force interactions within relativistic contexts.</div>

<div class='title'>A Model for Synchronous Physical Law Variation and Space Typology Based on Gravitational Fields</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/anton_rudy">Anton Rudy</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We propose a new model in which the fundamental physical constants, such as the speed of light and the gravitational constant, vary synchronously across the entire universe. This variation depends on the local gravitational field, leading to a classification of space into different "types" based on gravitational strength. These space types influence the manifestation of both quantum and classical laws. Our model offers a novel approach to unify quantum mechanics with classical physics and potentially explains phenomena such as dark matter, dark energy, quantum gravity, and the mass of neutrinos. Additionally, we discuss how this model aligns with the theory of relativity and accounts for phenomena like time dilation observed in GPS systems.</div>

<div class='title'>The Significant Gaps and Errors in the Interpretations of Special Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/tadeusz_pastuszek">Tadeusz Pastuszek</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This article critically examines the commonly overlooked gaps and errors in the interpretations of the Special Theory of Relativity (STR), particularly in the treatment of the external and internal observers, the role of the Lorentz transformation, and the misapplication of moving reference frames. The core argument revolves around the objective versus subjective observations within STR, emphasizing the pivotal role of an external observer who perceives spacetime as a whole, in contrast to the limited perspective of internal observers. The discussion further extends to mathematical misinterpretations, such as the dimensional alignment of time and space, the improper handling of inertial frames, and inconsistencies in the application of Newtonian mechanics within relativistic contexts. These gaps underscore the needfor a refined conceptual framework in interpreting STR, paving the way for a more rigorous understanding of relativistic dynamics and its implications for modern physics.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jameel_chamberlain">Jameel Chamberlain</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Bubble Theory proposes a higher-dimensional framework in which the fourth spatial dimension hosts multiple energy-matter structures, or "bubbles," coexisting within the same spatiotemporalcoordinates. Central to this theory is the &#8217;S&#8217; Energy Field, a higher-dimensional field through whichunique &#8217;S&#8217; Energy wavelengths propagate, binding matter and maintaining bubble integrity. This paper extends the Bubble Theory to explore its implications for black holes, dark matter, dark energy,and quantum phenomena. By modeling these cosmic phenomena through the lens of the BubbleTheory, we aim to provide new insights and propose potential avenues for experimental validation.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper presents a novel interpretation of cosmological redshift within the framework of the Spacetime Superfluid Hypothesis (SSH).

We derive the fundamental equations governing light propagation in superfluid spacetime, present predictions for observational tests, and discuss the implications for our understanding of the cosmos.</div>

<div class='title'>A Proposed Resolution to Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Replacing Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry Via Axiomatization of Torricelli's Homogeneous Infinitesimals</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jeffrey_p_baugher">Jeffrey P. Baugher</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The conundrum of Dark Matter coupled with the discovery in 1998 that the universe is paradoxically accelerating its expansion has led some cosmologists to question the correctness of the non-Euclidean geometric theory of gravity, General Relativity. In the 17th century, there was also a great paradox between two views for the geometric constituents of a line, heterogeneous (made of points) versus homogeneous (made of infinitesimal segments). Evangelista Torricelli, a protege of Galileo, elucidated his logical reasoning on why lines must be made of segments and not points and created one particular fundamental example among many. In this paper, I produce unknown corollaries to Torricelli's argument allowing me to falsify the relationship between infinitesimals and the Archimedean axiom, resolve L'Hopital's paradox, rewrite the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and derive Gaussian curvature. I hypothesize that the intractability of Dark Energy and Dark Matter is due to the points of coordinate systems within General Relativity actually being a logically flawed heterogeneous interpretation with basis vectors as a stand-in for the properties of homogeneous infinitesimals. I propose a novel but geometrically logical model for gravity based on the changing area of ``surfaces" that suffers from no Cosmological Constant but can model red-shift of light. I present hypothetical arguments to demonstrate that there is sufficient compelling similarities to support the investigation of rewriting Euclidean/non-Euclidean geometry, the Calculus and all the laws of physics with axiomatic homogeneous infinitesimals of three components that each follow the theory of proportionality. They are relative cardinality, homogeneous infinitesimal and lastly their sum.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper contains reflections on how Newton's classical inverse-square law of gravitation corresponds to both Einstein's theory of special relativity adapted for an accelerated object, as well as Einstein's theory of general relativity for the free-fall of an object in a curved spacetime. Using a model described in detail in a related paper, viXra:2409.0004, it is shown that space and time are regular in the neighbourhood of a static point mass, and that a black hole and event horizon are mathematicalartefacts. In addition, since gravity does not diverge to infinity as masses approach each other, there is no singularity at the coordinate origin.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/greg_p_proper">Greg P. Proper</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This brief paper demonstrates that a mathematical solution to Einstein's field equations exists that features a sign change in what proves to be the analog to the Friedmann 2 (acceleration) equation. The purpose here is not to physically challenge the FLRW (Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson-Walker) solution, but to demonstrate that this sign change is mathematically possible. In order to achieve this result, the metric is modified so that the temporal increment is affected by the expansion in the same manner as the spatial increments. Unlike the Schwarzschild, there is no theorem that states that the R-W is mathematically unique. Therefore, from a purely mathematical perspective there is no prohibition on the exploration of other alternatives to the R-W. In this particular instance the four principal equations of cosmology reduce to two mathematically consistent equations and total energy is conserved.</div>

In the first chapter a model of special relativity is constructed, on the basis of which the priority of the massless form of matter is revealed. In the second chapter, a field model of inert and heavy mass is constructed and on this basis the mechanism of inertia and gravity of weighty bodies is revealed. In the third chapter, the example of geons shows the fundamental nature of a massless form of matter on the Planck scale. The three-dimensionality of the observable space is substantiated. In the fourth chapter, we consider a variant of solving the problem of singularities in general relativity using the example of multidimensional spaces.

<div class='abstract'>By recognising that Newtonian gravity is a manifestation of the time curvature in a curved four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold such asin Einstein's general theory of relativity(GR), it can be shown that space and time are completely regular in the neighbourhood of a static point mass, and therefore a black hole and event horizon are just mathematical artefacts.

In this dual space clocks run at equal rates to first order but coincide with the time dilation of metric space, due rather to different light path lengths. We find its mathematical properties coincide with the Gullstrand&#8212;Painleve coordinates, however the interpretation dictated by this model requiressome different concepts to that of the standard river model. Objects fall at equal rate in this space not because of equality of gravitational and inertial mass but because they are stationary in the dual space which itself is falling. The space behaves more Galilean than one might expect. We explore how escape velocity is modelled in this moving spacetime and address how the dual space re-interprets gravitational redshift to unify it with doppler and Hubble and as well as perhaps dark energy. natural aplications for mass variation and radiating charges stationery in gravity are also presented as a logical result of adopting the framework. We then touch on how the dual space can be modelled as a vector field in geometric algebra.</div>

<div class='title'>A Ricci Flow-Inspired Model for Cosmic Expansion: New Insights from BAO Measurements Preliminary Report</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/paul_chun-kit_lee">Paul Chun-Kit Lee</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recent precision measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have revealed tensions with predictions from the standard &#923;CDM cosmological model. This paper presents a novel approach to addressing these discrepancies by incorporating geometric flow concepts inspired by Perelman&#8217;s work on Ricci flow. We introduce a modified Friedmann equation that includes a Ricci flow term, providing a geometric framework for understanding potential deviations from standard cosmology. Our model shows significant improvement in fitting DESI BAO measurements across a wide range of redshifts, suggesting a possible geometric origin for observed cosmic expansion anomalies. Parameter space analysis reveals subtle interplay between logarithmic and power-law contributions to the expansion history, potentially offering new insights into the nature of dark energy or modifications to general relativity on cosmological scales.</div>

<div class='title'>Ricci Flow Techniques in General Relativity and Quantum Gravity: A Perelman-Inspired Approach to Spacetime Dynamics</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/paul_chun-kit_lee">Paul Chun-Kit Lee</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper presents a novel approach to quantum gravity, extending Perelman&#8217;s Ricci flow techniques to Lorentzian manifolds and developing a unified geometric framework that bridges concepts from differential geometry, topology, and quantum field theory. This offers fresh perspectives on fundamental problems in theoretical physics. Our core contribution lies in the formulation of a modified Ricci flowequation tailored for Lorentzian manifolds. This new equation incorporates gauge fields and establishesmeaningful connections with quantum mechanics.In exploring the implications of our framework, we examine singularity analysis in geometric flows and spacetime, proposing a new classification scheme for spacetime singularities. We also delve into thedevelopment of entropy functionals, highlighting their monotonicity properties in Lorentzian contexts. Furthermore, we introduce a "no local collapsing" theorem vital for understanding the long-term behavior of geometric flows, complemented by studies on the long-time existence and convergence results forLorentzian Ricci flow with surgery. The classification of gradient shrinking solitons is explored as models for singularity formation. Additionally, we discuss the framework&#8217;s connections to physics, which couldprovide new insights into black hole thermodynamics, cosmic evolution, and the application of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The paper establishes rigorous mathematical foundations for these concepts and includes detailed proofs and analyses in the appendices. We propose experimental tests and observational strategies tovalidate our theoretical predictions. While this work is highly theoretical, it suggests innovative approaches to longstanding problems in quantum gravity and cosmology, offering a geometric perspective on quantum phenomena and proposing mechanisms for singularity resolution and the emergence of classical spacetime from quantum geometry. Although some aspects of our discussion remain speculative, we emphasize the need for further theoretical development and experimental validation. This frameworkequips researchers with a novel mathematical toolkit to explore the interface between gravity and quantum mechanics, potentially paving new avenues in the quest for a theory of quantum gravity.</div>

<div class='title'>A Classical Wave Model of Quasi-Static General Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_a_close">Robert A. Close</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>General relativity can be difficult for undergraduate students to comprehend, partly because the math is difficult and partly because it is not based on a simple physical model. However, in many situations general relativity can be interpreted as ordinary wave refraction in a non-uniform medium, with the refractive index (or wave speed) derived from only two independent components of a spatially isotropic diagonal spacetime metric. This work utilizes an elastic solid model of the vacuum to explain how the presence of wave energy would modify a medium to produce the metric variations of general relativity in a quasi-static environment. This analysis provides model-based explanations for many predictions of general relativity, including curved space, black holes, gravitational waves, and the different accelerations of light and massive objects.</div>

We also disagree with him about his manner and attitude which he adopted in his campaign against special relativity although we generally agree with him about the necessity of impartiality of the scientific community and the scientific press towards scientific theories and opinions as well as the necessity of total respect to the ethics of science and the rules of moral conduct in general.</div>

<div class='title'>Origin of the Big Bang' Singularity (Entangled Dawn Model)</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/michael_prince">Michael Prince</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>For [a long time], scientists and philosophers have grappled with the enigma of the Big Bang&#8217;s singularity, seeking to understand the primordial trigger that ignited the universe&#8217;s explosive expansion. Despite significant advances in cosmology, the origins of this singularity remain shrouded in mystery, fueling ongoing debate and research. We all learn that the Big Bang marked the birth of our observable universe from an ultra-hot, ultra-dense singularity of infinite density and zero volume. But if we follow the logic rigorously, this conventional picture turns out to be incomplete and inconsistent with some fundamental premises. For any volumetric increase or growth to occur, there must be pre-existing available space or "room" to expand into initially. This intuitive - things simply cannot begin increasing in size if there is no space to expand into. Now consider the conventional model of the Big Bang - our entire observable universe emerged from an initial state of infinite density called the "singularity" which had zero volume. Zero volume means no dimensions, no space whatsoever. Here&#8217;s the key point - if the singularity truly started with zero volume, and yet it expanded rapidly in all directions producing the vast volumes we see today, then there logically had to be some pre-existing space surrounding that singularity to allow for that expansion. Total zero volume couldn&#8217;t just grow spontaneously into something with dimension - that violates the premise. But there&#8217;s more. In our current understanding, the concepts of space and time are inseparably interlinked through Einstein&#8217;s theories. Space and time are woven together into the fabric of spacetime. So if there was pre-existing space before the ingularity, basic logic demands there must also have been some form of pre-existing time dimension as well. I know this may seem contradictory to the standard idea that space and time themselves emerged from the Big Bang event. But follow the logic clearly &#8212; if there was room for the expansion, and space implies time, then some sort of primordial space-time must have pre-dated the singularity itself. This doesn&#8217;t negate or deny the Big Bang paradigm. The initial inflation could still have propelled the singularity outwards rapidly creating the spacetime we experience today. But it shows that the Big Bang wasn&#8217;t the beginning of all existence - some earlier form of space and time had to have preceded and allowed for that expansion in the first place.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Gravitational Nature of Time</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/a_c_mueller">A.C. Mueller</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A novel geometry is presented which yields several observed quantities that are not accounted for by classical relativistic models. Relative motion is re-examined under which a numerically equivalent function is applied. This function dictates that velocities should remain equivalent across reference frames, which in turn implies that it is not time alone that dilates, but rather the time elapsed between two points in space for a given velocity as space itself dilates.A peculiar velocity of $bar{v} approx 526.6 ~ text{km} ~ text{s}^{-1}$ is presented and briefly compared with studies carried out through direct observation via supernovae luminosity and CMB research. A velocity proportional spatial dilation of $frac{ds}{dx} = Phi approx 1.618$ is also presented with an error of $0.002%$. This model predicts a mechanism of gravity which can, with further research, offer an explanation for the bullet cluster's varied mass effects, the apparent lack of gravitational aberration, and potentially excess galactic rotation curves without the need for CDM.</div>

<div class='title'>Transformation of a Singular "Event Horizon" to any Radius Value: Reductio Ad Absurdum of Transformation Covariance Being More than a Dynamic Symmetry</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Due to David Hilbert's 1918 promotional efforts, J. Droste's May 27, 1916 metric solution of the Einstein equation for a static point mass fixed to the origin is universally featured by gravity textbooks, but is seriously misrepresented by those textbooks as the work of Karl Schwarzschild: Droste's metric solution has a well-known singular "event horizon" at the Schwarzschild radius, but Schwarzschild's January 13, 1916 metric solution is singular only at the origin. Here we present a simple family of transformations of Droste's singular "event horizon" to any radius value whatsoever. The blatant absurdity of, say, the earth's gravitational field having a singular "event horizon" at some arbitrary height above the earth's surface establishes beyond all doubt that gravitational general coordinate transformation covariance is, exactly like electromagnetic gauge transformation covariance, merely a dynamic symmetry which is unavoidably broken by the unique physical metric solution.</div>

<div class='title'>Unlike Newton's Gravitational Acceleration, Einstein's is Velocity-Dependent; it Repels Sufficiently Near-c Objects, Obviating the Need for "Dark Energy"</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>If a test body radially approaching a static point mass at near-c speed undergoes the same attractive gravitational acceleration as a nonrelativistic test body, its speed soon exceeds c. That doesn't occur because Einstein's gravitational acceleration by a static point mass is velocity-dependent; it counterintuitively repels a test body traveling radially at a speed sufficiently near c. Indeed, a basic feature of the gravitational refraction of light is that a radially-traveling light packet's speed increases monotonically toward c with its increasing radial distance from a static point mass, so a light packet traveling radially away from a static point mass is gravitationally accelerated toward radial speed c in the outward direction of its travel. Likewise, a test body traveling radially away from a static point mass at a speed sufficiently near c is counterintuitively gravitationally accelerated in the outward direction of its travel. The universe expands radially at a speed sufficiently near c to undergo such a counterintuitive gravitational acceleration in the outward direction of its radial expansion, "dark energy" isn't needed.</div>

<div class='title'>Krogh Quantum Gravity Explicitly Predicts Hubble Redshift Curve and JWST Findings Without Expansion</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/j_howard_drake">J. Howard Drake</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>JWST mature galaxies suggest an older universe. Studies show expansion imperfectly models redshift. Surface brightness and angular diameter distance do not support expansion. The crisis is resolved by replacing GR, while a new cause for redshift is found. We adopt gravity theory of Kris Krogh where gravity changes quantum vacuum rather than geometry. Redshift occurs at emission from earlier time dependent potential. A hot matter creation initiated gravity propagation changing light speed, particle mass, and physical constants. Cooling to CMB temperature achieved by mass change with momentum conservation. Estimated time for galaxy formation is 450 billion atomic years or 49 billion current years since CMB. Using cosmological principle with gravity dependency of terms in governing equation, we solve for time dependent potential since matter creation. We predict wavelength of past spectral lines, which when measured reveal emission time. Using determined variable light speed, we integrate to calculate distance from emission. We predict Hubble curve depending only on matter density without expansion or ad hoc parameters. Krogh gravity as updated remains consistent with successful GR tests and predicts testable new dynamics not predicted by GR. These include observed acceleration anomalies for Earth flybys, JUNO Jupiter orbiter, Pioneer Probe, apparent superluminal galactic jet acceleration, galaxy rotation, and more rapid growth of black holes through faster accretion. New dynamics explains MOND illusion and ring galaxy formation. JWST mature galaxies confirm older universe, while galactic jets confirm predicted higher light speed. Greater baryon mass density supports prolific star formation. Many stars are likely dead or consumed by black holes, so invisible baryon mass is expected to be greater than visible mass.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/tadeusz_pastuszek">Tadeusz Pastuszek</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Article explores the concept of dark matter, a postulate introduced to explain observed anomalies in the motion of cosmic objects, such as stars at the outskirts of galaxies and galaxies within clusters, that do not align with Newton's law of universal gravitation. Traditional gravitational theory, as well as Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, faces challenges in accounting for these discrepancies, including the Pioneer anomaly, the anomalous flyby effect, the behavior of Oumuamua, and the trajectory of asteroid Apophis. This paper posits that these anomalies can be explained by revising the law of universal gravitation itself, rather than introducing the concept of dark matter. By examining instances where the gravitational constant appears variable and the function of distance in gravitational equations deviates from expected values, the paper suggests an alternative approach to understanding cosmic phenomena. The implications of these findings on celestial navigation, the behavior of light in gravitational fields, and the structure of the universe are discussed, challenging prevailing theories and proposing a new direction for gravitational research.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Background: Mach's Principle posits that the inertia of a body is inuenced by the sum total of matter in the universe. This paper explores the relationship between gravitational potential energy and rest mass within the framework of Mach's Principle, utilizing a thought experiment involving the elevation of mass on Earth.Methods: The study employs a theoretical approach, beginning with a thought experiment that demonstrates the change in an object's rest mass due to alterations in gravitational potential energy. Subsequently, a mathematical model is developed to express rest mass as a function of distance from a massive central body, incorporating adjustments for observed astronomical phenomena such as the precession of Mercury's orbit.Conclusion: The findings affirm the principle that an object's rest mass is influenced by the gravitational potential of all other masses in the universe, aligning with Mach's Principle. The study underscores the need for revisiting the definitions of fundamental units of measurement such as the second and the meter, in light of gravitational dependency. The implications for astronomical theories, including gravitational redshift and the assessment of quasar emissions, are discussed, suggesting a potential reevaluation of existing models.</div>

<div class='title'>Unication of Electric and Gravitational Interaction in Classical Physics</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/tadeusz_pastuszek">Tadeusz Pastuszek</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper challenges the quantum-focused search for a unified theory of fundamental interactions by exploring the potential unification of electric and gravitational forces within classical physics. Highlighting the similarities between Coulomb's law and Newton's law of universal gravitation, it suggests that signs of unification should be observable on a acroscopic scale. The concept of gravitomagnetic fields, akin to magnetic fields in electromagnetism, is introduced, supported by experimental evidence from rotating masses and a notable experiment with a superconducting disk. This experiment hinted at the generation of a powerful gravitomagnetic field, suggesting a gravitational analogue to electromagnetic phenomena. The discussion extends to gravitational synchrotron radiation, proposing that celestial bodies in orbit emit this radiation, influencing their orbital dynamics. This concept is used to explain the observed mergers of black holes and neutron stars detected by gravitational wave observatories, framing these events as influenced by gravitational waves rather than spacetime vibrations. A central argument for unification is the treatment of rest mass as the true invariant gravitational charge, challenging the current understanding of black holes and suggesting they are states of matter with finite density without traditional event horizons. The paper concludes with a reevaluation of the Schwarzschild radius and event horizons, proposing thought experiments that question established interpretations and advocate for a classical physics approach to unifying gravitational and electric interactions.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We propose a topological object, a gravitational knot, could exist in low heat Schwarzschild black hole (Newton's theory of gravitation) by assuming that the Ricci curvature tensor especially the metric tensor consists of a scalar field i.e. a subset of the Ricci curvature tensor. The Chern-Simons action is interpreted as such a knot.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions:The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However one the major drawbacks concerning warp drives is the problem of the Horizons(causallydisconnected portions of spacetime) in which an observer in the center of the bubble cannot signal nor control the front part of the bubble.We present the behavior of a photon sent to the front of the bubble in the Natario warp drive in the $1+1$ spacetime with variable velocities and with or without lapse functions using quadratic forms and the null-like geodesics $ds^2=0$ of General Relativity and we provide here the step by step mathematicalcalculations in order to outline the final results found in our work which are the following ones: For both cases with variablevelocities and with or without the lapse function the Horizon do not exists at all.Due to the extra terms in the lapse function andin the variable velocities that affects the whole spacetime geometry these solutions allows to circumvent the problem of the Horizon.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Mass should be understood in terms of potential energy arising from vector potentials of force elds. It reevaluates Einstein's famousequation E = mc2 and suggests that rest mass (denoted as mr) is essentially a form of potential energy. The text challenges traditional views by proposing that the rest mass of subatomic particles is not con- stant but varies with the potential of the elds in which they are located. Through a series of theoretical discussions and thought experiments, the author explores the implications of this view for understanding the uni- verse, including the additivity of rest mass, the variability of subatomic particle masses, and the principle of minimum potential energy (or rest mass) governing all interactions and processes in the Universe.</div>

Hence, it is expected that a local observer can measure/harvest the energy. This means that the famous problem of energy localization should have a positive solution. I introduce an inertial coordinate system (a local inertial tetrad) and derive conservation laws from the covariant four-dimensional divergence of the energy-momentum tensor.

<div class='abstract'>At present, the idea that our space-time is emergent, as a kind of low-energy phase transition into some kind of condensed matter and superconductor, is becoming quite popular. This space-time is formed as a kind of new network, the volume of which, when measured in Planck units, is equal to the number of network nodes. The growth of such a network and the increase in its volume is not due to the stretching of existing cells, but as a result of adding new cells. Considering the growth of such a network in a similar way to the growth of the volume of a new phase, one can naturally explain the redshift and many other problems of modern cosmology.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 1915 Einstein adopted a new coordinate condition for his GR gravity theory, namely that the metric tensor's determinant always equals -1, its Minkowskian zero-gravity value. In his landmark November 18, 1915 paper, Einstein showed that applying this coordinate condition to the approximate calculation of the metric of a static point mass (the sun) results in agreement with the previously unaccounted-for part of Mercury's perihelion shift, and doubles the deflection of light by the sun's gravity from his previous calculation which didn't use this coordinate condition; a 1919 solar-eclipse expedition verified the doubled deflection. In January, 1916 Schwarzschild published the exact version of Einstein's new static point-mass metric; as expected, it slightly lengthens circular-orbit periods. In May 1916 Droste published a much simpler metric which violates the Einstein equation at an empty-space radius and fails to lengthen circular-orbit periods. In 1922 Friedmann tried fixing the metric's time-time component to unity, making it Galilean covariant instead of Lorentz covariant, and eliminating gravitational time dilation. We replace Friedmann's metric condition by Einstein's in the Oppenheimer-Snyder model; the resulting gravitational time dilation accommodates both the acceleration of the universe's expansion and its early inflation.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Null geodesics of a spacetime are a key factor in determining dynamics of particles. In this paper, it is argued that, within the scope of validity of Cosmological Principle where FLRW model can be safely employed, expansion of the Universe causes the null geodesics to accelerate, providing us with a universal acceleration scale a_0=cH_0. Since acceleration of null rays of spacetime corresponds to null rays of velocity space, demanding the invariance of acceleration of light a_0 yields a new metric for the velocity space which introduces time as a dimension of the velocity space. Being part of the configuration space, modification of distance measurements in velocity space alters the Euler-Lagrange equation and from there the equation of motion, Newton's Second Law. It is then seen that the resulting modification eliminates the need for Dark matter in clusters of galaxies and yields MOND as an approximation.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Certain preconceptions about the physical world inherited from antiquity as yet permeate our established theories of physics and cosmology. Tacitly prominent in this world view is the fact that humans evolved on a 5.97 x 10^24 kg ball of matter.One of the consequences is the "relativistic" point of view, according to which accelerometers may or may not be telling the truth, whether they fall (a = 0) or when they are "at rest" on a planet&#8217;s surface (a &gt; 0). The result of an experiment proposed by Galileo in 1632, but not yet performed, would unequivocally prove whether this schizoid relationship with accelerometers rings true or not.An imaginary alien civilization (of Rotonians) evolved on a rotating world in which the truthfulness of accelerometers is never doubted. Adopting a Rotonian perspective leads to a model of gravity according to which the result of Galileo&#8217;s experiment dramatically conflicts with the predictions of both Newton and Einstein.The consequences of this new perspective bear on and invite a rethink of many facets of established theories of physics and cosmology. Herein we discover that the Rotonian perspective is consistent with what we actually KNOW about the physical world and -- depending on the result of Galileo&#8217;s experiment -- it opens the door to a much more coherent, contradiction-free world view, which spans all scales of size, mass, and time.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Failure of LIGO physicists to provide a spacetime diagram showing the simultaneous laser paths and gravitational waves propagating through their interferometer is argued to be fatal to the whole enterprise.After establishing the cogency of this argument, the seemingly "unhackable" multi-messenger event GRB170817A is similarly placed under suspicion. Claims to have detected the gravitational waves from a coalescing neutron star binary suffer the red flag of a prominent (and suspiciously placed) glitch which prevented the event from triggering a real time alert to the community.Altogether, we have many reasons to suspect that all the claims of having detected gravitational waves are false. LIGO is a hoax. Perhaps the most dramatic way to expose the charade would be to at last perform the simple gravity experiment proposed by Galileo in 1632. We predict a result that conflicts with both Newton&#8217;s and Einstein&#8217;s theories of gravity. If our prediction is confirmed, gravitational waves and much else about modern gravitational theory would be falsified.Even if the result of Galileo&#8217;s experiment supports Newton and Einstein, we are way overdue to find out directly from Nature, instead of pretending to know, based on faith in popular theories.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Haug and Spavieri have recently presented a new exact solution to Einstein&#8217;s field equations. In this paper, we will explore how this new metric could potentially lead to a new model for the cosmos. In the Friedman model, the cosmological constant must be introduced ad-hoc in Einstein&#8217;s field equations or, alternatively, directly into the Friedmann equation. However, a similar constant automatically emerges in our cosmological model directly from Einstein&#8217;s original 1916 field equations, which initially did not include a cosmological constant. We will analyze this, and it appears that the cosmological constant is little more than an adjustment for the equivalence of the mass-energy of the gravitational field, which is not taken into account in other exact solutions but is addressed in the Haug and Spavieri solution. Our approach seems to indicate that the Hubble sphere can be rep- resented as a black hole, a possibility that has been suggested by multiple authors, but this is a quite different type of black-hole universe that seems to be more friendly than that of a Schwarzschild black-hole.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/greg_filewood">Greg Filewood</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The purpose of this study is to entrench the Copernican principle into cosmology with regard to dark energy (DE). A dual-universe solution is proposed for both the scale and coincidence problems of DE which is simple and involves no `fine-tuning'. It is also, in principle, testable and falsifiable. The model enables computation of the total entropy of the universe contained within the horizon expressed holographically projected onto the area of the cosmic horizon in units of Planck area. We subsequently compute the Planck entropy, which takes an irreducibly simple form. A derivation of the relation $[{DE}]={sqrt{m_{pl}.H_0}}$ is provided and we further show that this relation is valid in all (local i.e. $H'_{tau}=H'_0$) observer frames. We prove that the vacuum energy is exactly zero in this dual universe model. Lastly we propose that our analysis implies that the MOND paradigm is due to gravitation interaction of the two universes and we compute the MOND acceleration scale $a_0$ and scale invariant ${cal.{A}}_0$ as a consequence of cosmology, completely independent of galaxy dynamics. Significantly, this allows us to bring the MOND paradigm into a cosmological model without modifying General Relativity.</div>

<div class='title'>A Proof of the Rationality of the Definition of Momentum in Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chengshen_xu">Chengshen Xu</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we firstly use a new method--the invariance of space-time interval and some simple linear algebra knowledge to derive Lorentz transformations and four-dimensional vectors. Finally we discuss and prove how to define the force and the momentum in relativity which has not been discussed and proved in textbooks and scientific literature. The first three dimensions of a four-dimensional momentum are defined as momentum and the derivative of momentum with respect to time is defined as force. But there is a problem that the rationality of the definition of momentum is not discussed and proved. Force and momentum cannot be arbitrarily defined. Because if our senses are sensitive and sophisticated enough, only a correct definition can guarantee that when we accelerate an object with a constant force, the momentum will increase at a constant rate. It is not necessary to be discussed in classical mechanics, because in classical mechanics the force is proportional to the acceleration and the force comes before the momentum. But it is just the opposite that the momentum comes before the force in relativistic mechanics, so it's important to discuss and prove how to define the force and the momentum in relativity. In addition the fact that the same physical process does not depend on the space-time point means that the Lorentz transformations must be linear transformations, so we can derive Lorentz transformations and four-dimensional vectors by using the invariance of space-time interval and some simple linear algebra knowledge.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper presents the perspective that universe is relative. The universe, which changes according to the observer&#8217;s proper time, is dynamic.Generally, the universe expands, but if the observer accelerates enough,contraction is also possible. The Hubble parameter merely represents thatchange. If the Hubble parameter is dependent on the proper time, themeasurement can only be uncertain. Identifying the factors that influencethe proper time could potentially lead to a more accurate measurementof the universe&#8217;s age, and it could also offer insights into the state of theearly universe and the causes of the accelerated expansion observed in thecurrent epoch.</div>

<div class='abstract'>By applying the theory of variable speed of light, the galactic red-shift can be described as aphenomenon, which only SEEMS to be a movement and it can be explained by the variation ofthe cosmic gravitational potential. An alternative concept of the universe is developed, whereasonly very general assumptions about the properties of the universe are made. The worldviewarising from that is simpler than the Standard Model. The theory of variable speed of light isable to describe the Hubble diagram consistently in a new way, nevertheless, without having tointroduce any parameters.</div>

<div class='title'>Jacobi and Lagrangian Formulation of the Classical Cosmological Equations</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/riddhiman_bhattacharya">Riddhiman Bhattacharya</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Classical mechanics has been a well-established field for many years, but there are still some challenges that can be addressed using modern techniques. When dealing with classical mechanics problems, the first step is usually to create amathematical expression called the Hamiltonian based on a known function called the Lagrangian. This involves using standard procedures to establish relationships like the Poisson bracket, canonical momenta, Euler-Lagrange equations, andHamilton-Jacobi relations. In this paper, we focus on a specific problem related to the calculus of variations, which deals with finding the Lagrangian function that, when used in the Euler-Lagrange equation, produces a given differentialequation. To tackle this problem, we employ two distinct methods to determine the Lagrangian and, subsequently, the Hamiltonian for the cosmological equations derived from General Relativity. These equations describe the motion of celestial objects in the universe and are of second-order in nature.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The paper commences by examining the geometric properties of de-Sitter space-time,with a specific focus on the isometries generated by Killing vectors. It also investigatesvarious metrics that are applicable to specific regions of space-time, revealing that in thedistant future, the symmetries exhibit a similar local structure to that of $R^3$.Furthermore,the classical Klein-Gordon equation is solved within this space-time, leading to the discoverythat energy is not conserved. The solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation yield intriguing outcomes that have the potential to enable observations from the early inflationary era.Finally, the primary objective of the paper is to comprehensively examine a quantized scalarfield in the de-Sitter background, exploring the solutions for the two-point function andanalyzing their behavior during both early and late time periods.</div>

<div class='title'>Solving Cosmological Constant Problem</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/felix_m_lev">Felix M. Lev</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Physicists usually believe that physics cannot (and should not) derive the values of c and &#1115; but should derive the value of the cosmological constant &#923;. This problem is considered fundamental after the phenomenon of cosmological acceleration (PCA) was discovered in 1998. This phenomenon is usually considered in the framework of General Relativity (GR) and here the main uncertainty is how the background space is treated. If it is flat, PCA is usually treated as a manifestation of dark energy and (as acknowledged in the literature) currently its nature is a mystery. On the other hand, if it is curved then a problem arises why the value of &#923; is as is. However, in our approach based only on universally recognized results of physics, the solution of the problem does not contain uncertainties because PCA is an inevitable kinematical consequence of quantum theory in semiclassical approximation. Since the de Sitter (dS) algebra is semisimple, it is the most general ten-dimensional Lie algebra because it cannot be obtained by contraction from other ten-dimensional Lie algebras. Let R be the parameter of contraction from the dS algebra to the Poincare one. Then the problem why the quantities (c,&#1115;,R) are as are does not arise because they are contraction parameters for transitions from more general Lie algebras to less general ones. In our approach, background space and its geometry (metric and connection) are not used but, in semiclassical approximation, the result for PCA is the same as in GR if &#923;=3/R^2.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The constancy of the speed of light seems to imply that time and space are not absolute; however, we intend to show that that is not necessarily the case.

We prove this formulation is mathematically equivalent to Einstein's theory by deriving the Lorentz transformation from the Galilean transformation for frames of reference in four-dimensional Euclidean space.</div>

<div class='title'>Gravitational Time Dilation, Relativistic Gravity Theory, Schwarzschild's Physically Sound Original Metric and the Consequences for Cosmology</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is natural to assume that the expanding universe was arbitrarily compact in the sufficiently remote past, in which state gravitational time dilation strongly affected its behavior. We first regard gravitational time dilation as the speed time dilation of a clock falling gravitationally from rest. Energy conservation implies that this depends solely on the the Newtonian gravitational potential difference of the clock trajectory's ends. To extend this to the relativistic domain we work out relativistic gravity theory. The metric result it yields for gravitational time dilation is consistent with our Newtonian gravitational potential result in the Newtonian limit. However the Robertson-Walker metric form for the universe implies complete absence of gravitational time dilation. Since we assume the universe was once arbitrarily compact, we turn instead to the metric for a static gravitational point source, but find that its textbook form puts a sufficiently compact universe inside an event horizon. This is due to transformation of the three radial functions which describe a static, spherically-symmetric metric into only two before inserting that now damaged metric form into the Einstein equation. Schwarzschild's original metric solution, which isn't in textbooks, involved no such transformation and therefore is physically sound; we obtain from it a picture of a universe which had an outburst of star and galaxy formation in the wake of its inflation.</div>

<div class='title'>The IRPL Model of Cosmology</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/vincenzo_peluso">Vincenzo Peluso</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A new cosmological model is proposed that does not require dark energy, yet presents characteristics and trends that are almost comparable to those of the standard model. It differs from the standard model by an "extra path factor" that comes from a central hypothesis and results in an additional distance due to the gravitational radius. This additional distance causes the matter density parameter to rise from 0.5 to 1 from the big bang to the present, which gives rise to a non-zero pressure that drives the present acceleration phase of the universe's expansion. Remarkably, the halving of the density during nucleosynthesis solves the primordial lithium problem, although it introduces a deuterium problem. Finally, the resulting model solves the Hubble tension and the S8 tension, and satisfies all the constraints derived from the most recent accurate measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, despite having one less parameter due to the absence of dark energy. The same hypothesis explains the rotating motion of galaxies on a small scale and produces consequences that are comparable to those of the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory.However, although the proposed model respects the same principles and physics as the standard model, it needs to be reinterpreted within the framework of the more original space of light to appreciate the naturalness of the hypothesis and its profound implications.</div>

<div class='title'>The Birth Mechanism of the Universe from Nothing and New Inflation Mechanism</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>There was a model claiming the birth of the universe from nothing, but the specific mechanism for the birth and expansion of the universe was very poor. According to the energy-time uncertainty principle, during &#916;t, an energy fluctuation of &#916;E is possible, but this energy fluctuation should have reverted back to nothing. By the way, there is also a gravitational interaction during the time of &#916;t, and if the negative gravitational self-energy exceeds the positive mass-energy during this &#916;t, the total energy of the corresponding mass distribution becomes negative energy, that is, the negative mass state. Because there is a repulsive gravitational effect between negative masses, this mass distribution expands. Thus, it is possible to create an expansion that does not go back to nothing. Calculations show that if the quantum fluctuation occur for a time less than &#916;t=(3/10)^(1/2)t_p ~ 0.77t_p, then an energy fluctuation of &#916;E &gt; (5/6)^(1/2)m_pc^2 ~ 0.65m_pc^2 must occur. But in this case, because of the negative gravitational self-energy, &#916;E will enter the negative energy (mass) state before the time of &#916;t. Because there is a repulsive gravitational effect between negative masses, &#916;E cannot contract, but expands. Thus, the universe does not return to nothing, but can exist. Gravitational Potential Energy Model provides a means of distinguishing whether the existence of the present universe is an inevitable event or an event with a very low probability. And, it presents a new model for the process of inflation, the accelerating expansion of the early universe. This paper also provides an explanation for why the early universe started in a dense state and solves the vacuum catastrophe problem. Additionally, when the negative gravitational potential energy exceeds the positive energy, it can produce an accelerated expansion of the universe. Through this mechanism, inflation, which is the accelerated expansion of the early universe, and dark energy, which is the cause of the accelerated expansion of the recent universe, can be explained at the same time.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Modified Theories of Gravity include spin dependence in General Relativity, to account for additional sources of gravity instead of dark matter/energy approach.The spin-spin interaction is already included in the effective nuclear force potential, and theoretical considerations and experimental evidence hint to the hypothesis that Gravity originates from such an interaction, under an averaging process over spin directions.This invites to continue the line of theory initiated by Einstein and Cartan, based on tetrads and spin effects modeled by connections with torsion. As a first step in this direction, the article considers a new modified Coulomb/Newton Law accounting for the spin-spin interaction. The physical potential is geometrized through specific affine connections and specific semi-Riemannian metrics, canonically associated to it, acting on a manifold or at the level of its tangent bundle. Freely falling particles in these "toy Universes" are determined, showing an interesting behavior and unexpected patterns.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Lorentz transformation is derived merely from the properties of space and time when spaceis empty and Galileo relativity. Additional postulates about the speed of light, reciprocity, and other ones are not necessary. Straight world lines are bijectively mapped onto straight world lines. This known fact is exploited in an illustrative manner. This is extremely useful for teaching special relativity, in particular, at an elementary level. Moreover, the approach described here, (i), provides an example of strict physical thinking, (ii), corrects a widespread erroneous belief, see over-next paragraph, and, (iii), presents an elementary introduction to the largely unknown hyperbolic rotations (the common rotations are circular). The transformation to be found is represented as a kind of rotation times a Lorentzian &#8216;scale factor&#8217;. This crucially simplifies the calculations and is much easier to grasp than a rather abstract ansatz with unknown coefficients. The rotation is proven to be hyperbolic rather than circular. After that, the scale factor turns out to equal unity in a most direct manner. The reciprocity property of the transformation is obtained as a by-product. Not special relativity makes an additional assumption for justifying the appearance of a seemingly additional natural constant, the speed of light in vacuum c, but classical mechanics does whence c disappears. Two common basic assumptions of classical mechanics lead not to the Galileo but to the Lorentz transformation. The existence of a maximum speed of bodies is shown to be a purely kinematic effect, too. Einstein&#8217;s second postulate is obtained as a by-product.</div>

<div class='title'>A New Way to Write The Newtonian Gravitational Equation Resolves What The Cosmological Constant Truly Is</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We demonstrate that there is a way to represent Newtonian gravity in a form that strongly resembles Einstein&#8217;s field equation, but it is still a fundamentally different type of equation. In the non-relativistic regime, it becomes necessary to ad hoc introduce a cosmological constant in order to align it with observations, similar to Einstein&#8217;s field equation. Interestingly, in 1917, Einstein also ad hoc inserted a cosmological constant in the Newtonian equation during his discussion on incorporating it into his own field equation. At that time, the cosmological constant was added to maintain consensus, which favored a steady-state universe.However, with the discovery of cosmological redshift and the shift in consensus towards an expanding universe, Einstein abandoned the cosmological constant. Then, around 1999, the cosmological constant was reintroduced to explain recent observations of distant supernovae. Currently, the cosmological constant is once again a topic of great interest and significance.Nevertheless, we will demonstrate that the cosmological constant is likely an ad hoc adjustment resulting from a failure to properly account for relativistic effects in strong gravitational fields. We are able to derive the cosmological constant and show that it is linked to corrections for relativistic effects in strong gravitational fields. In our model, this constant holds true for any strong field but naturally assumes different values, indicating that it is not truly a constant. Its value is constant only for the mass under consideration; for example, for the Hubble sphere, it always has the same value.Additionally, we will demonstrate how relativistic modified Newtonian theory also seems to resolves the black hole information paradox by simply removing it. This theory also leads to the conservation of spacetime. In general relativity theory, there are several significant challenges. One of them is how spacetime can change over time, transitioning from infinite curvature just at the beginning of the assumed Big Bang to essentially flat spacetime when the universe end up in cold death, while still maintaining conservation of energy all the way from the Big Bang to the assumed cold death of the universe. Can one really get something from nothing?</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper it is proposed that the clock or age difference predicted in the well known twin paradox thought experiment of special relativity is not a real effect, but only arises because proper clock rate changes when a real clock is transported to a state of higher kinetic energy have not been considered. The kinematic time dilation of SR is cancelled exactly by an increase in proper clock rate that arises due to an increase in optical electron transition frequency when taking into account the relativistic mass increase of a moving atomic clock.</div>

The deviation from linearity, which was shown by observations of high redshift Type Ia supernovae, is shown to be an apparent result of the velocity of light being affected by the gravitational field of the universe.

<div class='abstract'>We present an axiomatic foundation of non-integrable phases of Schr"{o}dinger wave functions and use it for interpreting Dirac's 1931 pioneering article in terms of the electromagnetic 4-potential. The quantization of the electric charge in terms of $e$ implies the quantization of the dielectric flux through closed surfaces $bar{Psi} := oiint vec{D} cdot mathrm{d}vec{S}$ in terms of the `Lagrangean' dielectric flux quantum $Psi_D=e$. The quantization of the analogous magnetic monopole charge in terms of $g$ implies the quantization of the magnetic flux through closed surfaces $bar{Phi} := oiint vec{B} cdot mathrm{d}vec{S}$ in terms of the `Diracian' magnetic induction flux quantum $Phi_B=g=h/e$, and textit{vice versa}. Here, the question is raised, if the quantization of the magnetic charge (and hence field) in a given volume depends on the total electric charge in that volume. Furthermore, we have $Phi_B/Psi_D = g/e = h/e^2 = R_text{K}$, the von Klitzing constant, the basic resistance of the quantum Hall effect. $R_text{K}$ and the vacuum permittivity $varepsilon_{0}$ and permeability $mu_{0}$, respectively, combine to two natural speed constants different from that of light in vacuum $c$.%footnote{This article is an extension of a talk presented (in German) before the Physical Society at Berlin, Febr. 15, 2023, url{https://www.dpg-physik.de/veranstaltungen/2023/mhb-agsen-2023-02-15}.}</div>

<div class='title'>Shear Excitations of the Electron Star Diffusion Out of Thermal Equilibrium</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matthew_stephenson">Matthew Stephenson</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The electron star is a holographic bulk setup which consists of a non-extremal AdS-Reissner-Nordstr"{o}m black brane and an ideal gas of electrons. The gravitational system is dual to a field theory with interacting fractionalised and mesonic degrees of freedom, and is thermodynamically favoured over a pure black brane scenario. The electron gas in this Einstein-Maxwell-fluid theory is treated as being at zero temperature. The system is thus gravitationally stable but is {it not} in thermodynamic equilibrium. After analysing thermodynamic properties of the background, we compute the quasi-normal mode spectrum and correlation functions of gauge-invariant quantities on the boundary to study momentum and charge transport in the shear sector. We perform a detailed analysis of the hydrodynamic diffusion mode dispersion relation and compare our numerical results with thermodynamic predictions. We show that they only agree at very low temperature and near transition to a purely black brane background. We thus conclude that in accordance with expectations, hydrodynamics and thermodynamics cannot successfully describe a system out of thermal equilibrium. This provides further evidence for the importance of holographic studies of thermalisation, hydrolysation and out-of-equilibrium phenomena.</div>

<div class='abstract'>It is impossible to create a correct 3D map of the observable part of the universedue to the fact that what we see around us is not a three-dimensional space.

In orderto correctly imagine the observable part of the universe, a four-dimensional map isnecessary. In this paper, I present one possible solution for constructing a 4D map ofthe universe.

<div class='title'>Unification Without Extra Dimensions</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dennis_adam_bluver">Dennis Adam Bluver</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we develop a modified Lagrangian for electrostatics based on the concept of voltage non-additivity, using recently-derived voltage boost transformation laws. Using a single dimensional physical space as a model, we solve the Euler-Lagrange equations for the electrostatic potential. It is shown that the modified electrostatic potential takes the form of a hyperbolic tangent function, where the function is approximately linear around the origin with horizontal asymptotes at the positive and negative Planck Voltages. Moreover, it is shown that the modified electrostatic Lagrangian automatically gives rise to classical gravitation as the leading correction term in the Taylor expansion of the solution. This provides a new interpretation of gravitation as a corrective term for electrostatics at very high voltages, wherein that term helps correct the potential in such a way that it never reaches the Planck Voltage. It is therefore a somewhat unique example of a unified field theory that does not assume the existence of extra dimensions. Future directions are discussed including possible implications for quantum gravity.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Acceleration is invariant under the Galilean transformations, which implies that a system moving at a nonzero constant velocity doesn't undergo acceleration it isn't already subject to when it is at rest. However a charged particle moving at a nonzero constant velocity in a static magnetic field undergoes acceleration it isn't subject to when it is at rest in that field (Faraday's Law or the Lorentz Force Law), and the needle of a magnetic compass moving at a nonzero constant velocity in a static electric field undergoes deflection it isn't subject to when it is at rest in that field (Maxwell's Law). The Galilean transformations therefore conflict with electrodynamics, and must be modified. Einstein obtained the modified Galilean transformations via postulating that the speed of light in empty space is fixed at the value c, which in fact is a consequence of electrodynamics rather than a postulate. Here we instead read off the space part of a modified constant-velocity Galilean transformation from the four-potential of a point charge moving at that constant velocity; its time part then follows from its space part plus either relativistic reciprocity (a fundamental property of the unmodified Galilean transformations) or the fixed speed c of light.</div>

<div class='title'>The Kilogram, Inertial Mass, Gravitational Mass and Types of Universal Free Fall</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/abhishek_majhi">Abhishek Majhi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>When gravitational motion of test objects are studied, two distinct concepts of mass are invoked in principle, namely, inertial mass and (passive) gravitational mass. If inertial mass and gravitational mass are quantities, then according to the definition of ``quantity'' available in the standard literature of metrology, there need to be specific units corresponding to inertial mass and gravitational mass. The possibilities of such definitions and the associated obstacles of reason are discussed. A recent classification of ``kilogram'' as a unit of inertial mass, that depends on the realization of kilogram through atom count method involving the use of matter wave interferometers, is critically analyzed. The process of reasoning that leads to such a classification is misleading because the equivalence between inertial mass and gravitational mass is an implicit assumption, in the process, both at the macroscopic level (mass measurement of silicon sphere) and the microscopic level (mass measurement of silicon atom with atom wave interferometers) resulting in no a priori distinction between inertial mass and gravitational mass in the concerned literature. Further inquiry reveals a crucial, but hitherto unexplained, difference between the working principles of neutron wave interferometers and atom wave interferometers. In neutron wave interferometers, the universal free fall of neutrons is attributed to the equality of inertial mass and gravitational mass, whereas in atom wave interferometers the distinction between inertial mass and gravitational mass is not made in the first place and universal free fall of atoms is attributed to either mass difference of the different species of atoms or different energy states of the same species of atom. Such observations result in the recognition of different {it types} of universal free fall that are studied in the literature which, however, has hitherto not been recognized assertively.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The hypothetical dark matter and dark energy play the role of sources of gravity, supplementing what General Relativity predicts based on the observed masses in the Universe.This brief note accounts for this additional G-force / potential based on the Theory of Gravity of quantum origin, emerging from the quark structure of matter.This supplemental gravity is due to the presence of fractional charges of quarks, which yield different interaction strengths depending on the polarization of spin directions of neutrons and protons. In the presence of high intensity magnetic fields of rotating systems (neutron stars, galaxies etc.) the change in polarization of spins affects the intensity of the gravitational field. Note that such a dependence cannot be accounted for my GR via only the metric of space-time.This is consistent with theories of Modified Gravity on fiber bundles, including spin for instance, as effective theories of Gravity without black matter and black energy.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this article, the author demonstrates that there is a huge contradiction between the statements made in the famous literature about general relativity regarding the vanishing covariant divergence of the energy-momentum tensor of matter representing a conservation law. It is reasoned which of these contradictory standpoints are correct and which are not. The author points out why pseudotensors cannot represent the energy density of the gravitational field. Contrary to the statements in the famous literature about general relativity, the energy density of the gravitational field is shown to be described by a tensor. Moreover, the author demonstrates that in general relativity there necessarily exists the conservation of total energy, momentum, and stress regarding the completed version of Einstein's field equations which is that one with the cosmological constant, whereby the latter one takes on a completely new meaning that solves the cosmological constant problem. This new interpretation of the cosmological constant also explains the dark energy and the dark matter phenomenon. The modified Poisson equation, that is obtained from Einstein's field equations with the cosmological constant in the limit of weak gravitational fields, approximately meets the requirement of conservation of total energy in Newton's theory of gravity, whereby flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies are obtained.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/david_f_crawford">David F. Crawford</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Curvature-cosmology is a tired-light cosmology that predicts a well-defined static and stable universe. Since it is a complete challenge to the big bang paradigm, it can only be judged by its agreement with direct cosmological observations. It predicts a universe of a hydrogen plasma with a temperature of $2.456times10^9,$K [observed: $2.62times 10^9$K] and a cosmic background radiation temperature of 2.736 K [observed: 2.725K]. It has only one parameter which is the density of the cosmic plasma. In addition this paper provides a new simpler raw data analysis for Type Ia supernova which provides excellent predictions for the redshift variation of Type I supernova light curve width and magnitude. A new discovery is intrinsic magnitude distribution. The analysis of 746,922 quasars provides important cosmological information on the distribution on intrinsic magnitudes and the density distribution of quasars. Other major observations that are shown to be consistent with Curvature-cosmology are: Tolman surface density, galaxy clusters, angular size, galaxy distributions, X-ray background radiation, and quasar variability. It does not need inflation, dark matter or dark energy.</div>

As a Universal antigravity force, it causes centrifugal accelerated motion of the galaxies with radial direction to the periphery of the Universe and as a nuclear antigravity force on which the architecture of the nuclei model is based. Also, as a particulate antigravity force, it prevents the further gravitational collapse and destruction of the vacuum bubbles (Higgs bosons) in the core of the neutrons, that build the black holes in the form of grid space matter, consisting of polyhedral cells, like bubbles in a foamed liquid.

<div class='title'>Cosmology of Inevitable Flat Space</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/farid_abrari">Farid Abrari</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In the combined theory of Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics (c-SRQM), the upper limit of local acceleration is constrained to c2/A, where c is the speed of light and A is the diameter of the event horizon of the smallest black hole in nature - called the Unit Black Hole (UBH). In this article, a new cosmological model is proposed wherein the flatness of the universe is inevitable from the onset. The theory indicates that at any given moment of the cosmic evolution, the age of the universe can be expressed as some integer multiple of the cosmological time constant A/c. The integer multiple 1, signifies the end of the Big Bang at which the initial conditions undergo a sudden change. The known universe is then shown to be the observable portion of a much bigger structure - named the grand universe - which is originated from a Primordial Black Hole (PBH) expanding with the limit rate c2/A at time A/c. It is shown that the dipole in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) could be explained by the anisotropy in the gravitational redshift of the grand universe. Moreover, a best fit to the observational Hubble diagram is obtained when the absolute luminosity of type Ia supernovae is constrained to 3.02e9 times that of the sun. The age of the universe is found to be 15.96e9 (years). The new age is higher than that of the standard cosmology by 2.14e9 (years), therefore, reducing the age discrepancy between the universe and the old metal-deficient stars. The actual value of the Hubble constant Ho is found to be 40.83 (km/sec/Mpc). The discrepancy with the current estimates of the constant is due to neglecting the gravitational redshift of the grand universe in the current standard cosmology.</div>

<div class='title'>From Neutrino Masses to the Full Size of the Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/bodo_lampe">Bodo Lampe</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Our universe is a 3-dimensional elastic substrate which once has condensed and now is expanding within some higher dimensional space. The elastic substrate is built from tiny invisible constituents, called tetrons, with bond length about the Planck length and binding energy the Planck energy. All ordinary matter particles are quasiparticle excitations of the tetrons gliding on the elastic medium. Since the quasiparticles fulfill Lorentz covariant wave equations, they perceive the universe as a 3+1 dimensional spacetime continuum lacking a preferred rest system. Any type of mass/energy induces curvature on the spacetime continuum as determined by the Einstein equations. The 24 known quarks and leptons arise as eigenmode excitations of a tetrahedral fiber structure, which is made up from 4 tetrons and extends into 3 additional `internal' dimensions. While the laws of gravity are due to the elastic properties of the tetron bonds, particle physics interactions take place within the internal fibers. I will concentrate on three of the most intriguing features of the model: (i) Understanding small neutrino masses from the conservation of isospin, and, more in general, calculating the spectrum of quark and lepton masses. This is obtained from the tetron model's interpretation of the Higgs mechanism. As a byproduct, the connection between the large top mass and the electroweak symmetry breaking becomes apparent. (ii) The possibility to determine the full size of the universe from future dark energy measurements. This is obtained from the tetron model's interpretation of the dark energy effect. In the course of discussion, the dark energy equation of state, i.e. the equation of state of the elastic tetron background will be derived. (iii) Finally, the origin of the big bang `Hubble tension' within the tetron scheme will be elucidated, and deviations from the standard picture such as a varying Newton constant are discussed.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We will demonstrate that the mass (equivalent mass) of the observable universe divided by the universe radius is exactly identical to the Planck mass divided by the Planck length.

<div class='title'>Dark Energy is Gravitational Potential Energy or Energy of the Gravitational Field</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>When the bound object acts on gravity, the gravitational action of gravitational potential energy is also included. Therefore, even in the case of the universe, the gravitational action of gravitational potential energy must be considered. Gravitational potential energy generates a repulsive force because it has a negative equivalent mass. Mass energy (Mc^2) is an attractive component, and the equivalent mass (-M_gp) of gravitational potential energy is a repulsive component. Therefore, if |(-M_gp)c^2}| &lt; Mc^2, there is a decelerated expansion, and if |(-M_gp)c^2| &gt; Mc^2, accelerated expansion is performed. |(-M_gp)c^2| = Mc^2 is the inflection point from the decelerated expansion to the accelerated expansion. Dark energy is gravitational potential energy or the energy of the gravitational field. Dark energy arises because any positive energy (mass) contained within the range of gravitational interaction creates negative gravitational potential energy. While positive mass energy is proportional to M, absolute value of gravitational potential energy increases faster because gravitational potential energy is proportional to -M^2/R. Therefore, as the universe ages and the range of gravitational interaction expands, a situation arises where the negative gravitational potential energy becomes greater than the positive mass energy, and thus the universe is accelerating expansion. I present Friedmann equations and dark energy function obtained through gravitational potential energy or gravitational self-energy model. There is no cosmological constant and dark energy is a function of time. This model predicts an inflection point where dark energy becomes larger and more important than the energy of matter and radiation.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/vincenzo_peluso">Vincenzo Peluso</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A new cosmological model is presented, with characteristics and trends very similar to those of the standard model, but without dark energy.&lt;br&gt; It differs from the standard one essentially for a constant of integration, which derives from a hypothesis at the centre of this work, which gives rise to an extra spatial distance and an extra fictitious component of matter.&lt;br&gt; Due to these extra parts, the density parameter of matter is no longer constant but increases from 0.5 to 1 from the beginning of time to the present day, although the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, and although the total amount of energy and matter are constant.&lt;br&gt; Consequently, the new model, which has one less parameter, satisfies all the constraints arising from the current accurate measurements of the BAO and the angular power spectrum of the CMB with the values of the density parameters of matter which, according to the theory, apply in each context.&lt;br&gt; Analogously, it solves the Hubble tension and the primordial lithium problem, although it introduces a deuterium problem.&lt;br&gt; Finally, it shows that it is the pressure of matter due to its variability, not dark energy, that drives the current acceleration phase of the expansion of the universe started by z &#8773; 0.5099, when the universe was 7.99 billion years old, about 5 billion years ago.&lt;br&gt; On a small scale, the same hypothesis has very similar effects to the MOND theory and explains the rotational motion of galaxies.</div>

Simple models are then set up to explore the astrophysical and cosmological reach of the proposed ideas, including their potential (and so far tentative) agreement with the &#8217;classical tests&#8217;of GR.

<div class='abstract'>In this note I have discussed Einstein's theory of special relativity, derived the coordinate transformations in a simple manner, and obtained expressions for time dilation, the relativistic Doppler effect and length contraction. In Einstein's original paper, a factor \phi appears, which he sets equal to unity. However, \phi can be reinterpreted as a scale factor when coordinate time is defined via a single coordinate clock and the time delay receiving information via light rays is included. Using Einstein's definition of coordinate time, a moving sphere is construed as an ellipsoid of revolution, whereas the practical definition of time intervals used here - implying simultaneity of reception rather than simultaneity of occurrence - shows it is a rotated sphere.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Solution of the Strong Gravitational Field, the Solution of the Singularity Problem, the Origin of Dark Energy and Dark Matter</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In order to apply general relativity to a strong gravitational field, the gravitational self-energy of the object itself must be considered. By considering the gravitational self-energy, it is possible to solve the singularity problem, which is the biggest problem with general relativity. When an object acts on gravity, the gravitational action of gravitational potential energy is also included. Therefore, even in the case of the universe, the gravitational action of gravitational potential energy must be considered. Gravitational potential energy generates a repulsive force because it has a negative equivalent mass. For the observable universe, I calculated the negative gravitational self-energy, which is approximately three times greater than the positive mass energy, which can explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. The source of dark energy is presumed to be due to gravitational self-energy and an increase in mass due to the expansion of the particle horizon. It is calculated that the effect of dark energy is occurring because matter and galaxies entering the particle horizon contribute to the total gravitational potential energy. While mass energy is proportional to M, gravitational self-energy increases faster because gravitational self-energy is proportional to -M^2/R. Accordingly, an effect of increasing dark energy occurs. I present Friedmann's equations and dark energy function obtained through gravitational self-energy model. There is no cosmological constant, dark energy is a function of time. This model predicts an inflection point where dark energy becomes larger and more important than the energy of matter and radiation.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Black Hole Cosmology that "the universe we observe is the interior of a black hole" was proposed in the 1970's. However, this Black Hole Cosmology is known to have several fatal flaws. In the black hole, singularity exist in the future, whereas in the real universe, singularity exist in the past. And, while the objects inside the black hole are moving toward the singularity, the observed universe is an expanding universe, and it looks completely opposite to each other. Moreover, since black holes are images that decompose humans into atomic units through strong tidal forces, the claim that humans are living inside black holes has not been seriously considered. In this study, I will solve the singularity problem and prove that humans can live inside a sufficiently large black hole. Inside a universe black hole, there is an almost flat space-time larger than the observable universe. There is also the possibility of solving the problem of cosmic expansion inside a black hole. Therefore, I would like to request new interest and research on Gravitational Self-Energy and Black Hole Cosmology through this study.</div>

<div class='title'>The Expansion of Spacetime</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/a_j_owen">A. J. Owen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, the physical universe is modelled as an expanding Minkowski space, and this obviates the need for dark energy to be included in the cosmological model. The observed accelerated expansion in the current epoch can be understood purely on the basis of a mass-dominated universe, where deceleration due to gravity is more than compensated for by expansion of the time dimension. In the epoch prior to this, when a linear expansion of the scale factor occurred, the universe was radiation-dominated, and in the very early exponentially expanding universe, cosmic inflation can be attributed to an expanding ensemble of non-interacting particles. This is very different behaviour from that deduced from the currently accepted cosmological model.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/tai-choon_yoon">Tai-Choon Yoon</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Energy is everywhere. Energy propagates by wave and light, and has no mass. So light is a wavelength. Einstein introduced a particle called photon to explain the photoelectric effect, and it is said that light causes the photoelectric effect. Therefore, the conclusion so far is that ``Light is both a particle and a wavelength''. Energy is an independent entity with a physical quantity and is quantized according to Planck's law. Energy can be measured in terms of temperature, and can also be expressed in terms of mass-energy according to the mass-energy equivalence principle. Energy can raise the temperature of a matter, or it can provide energy for a matter to move. They are related to each other but act independently. All matters have potential energy and thermal energy separately inside. The internal potential energy $(E_p)$ of a matter does not interact with thermal energy or external kinetic energy $(E_k)$. Particles in the microscopic world can either emit or absorb energy, or they can release energy through mass deficits that release parts of matter. It can be seen that Einstein's field equation is an equation to which the law of conservation of mass-energy applies. Therefore,from Einstein's field equations, we can derive out the matter-dominated universe and energy-dominated universe, respectively.</div>

<div class='title'>The Analysis of Siyu Bian,yi Wang, Zun Wang and Mian Zhu Applied to the Natario-Broeck Spacetime: a Very Interesting Approach Towards a More Realistic Interstellar Warp Drive</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However one of the major drawbacks that affects both warp drive spacetimes are the collisions with hazardous interstellar matter (asteroids, comets, interstellar dust etc) that will unavoidably occurs when a ship travels at superluminal speeds across interstellar space. The problem of collisions between a warp drive spaceship moving at superluminal velocity and the potentially dangerous particles from the Interstellar Medium $IM$ is not new.It was first noticed in $1999$ in the work of Chad Clark, Will Hiscock and Shane Larson.Later on in $2010$ it appeared again in the work of Carlos Barcelo, Stefano Finazzi and Stefano Liberatti. In $2012$ the same problem of collisions against hazardous $IM$ particles would appear in the work of Brendan McMonigal, Geraint Lewis and Philip O'Byrne. Some years ago in $1999$ Chris Van Den Broeck appeared with a very interesting idea. Broeck proposed a warp bubble with a large internal radius able to accommodate a ship inside while having a submicroscopic outer radius and a submicroscopic contact external surface in order to better avoid the collisions against the interstellar matter. The Broeck spacetime distortion have the shape of a bottle with $200$ meters of inner diameter able to accommodate a spaceship inside the bottle but the bottleneck possesses a very small outer radius with only $10^{-15}$ meters $100$ billion time smaller than a millimeter therefore reducing the probabilities of collisions against large objects in interstellar space. Recently a very interesting work appeared.It covers the analysis of Siyu Bian, Yi Wang, Zun Wang and Mian Zhu applied to the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime. But the most important fact: their analysis also applies to the Natario warp drive spacetime.In this work we applied the analysis of Siyu Bian ,Yi Wang, Zun Wang and Mian Zhu to the Natario-Broeck warp drive spacetime and we arrived at the following conclusion: The analysis of Siyu Bian ,Yi Wang, Zun Wang and Mian Zhu proves definitely that the Natario-Broeck warp drive spacetime is the best candidate for a realistic interstellar space travel.</div>

Three, we utilize a discussion as to Bose{Einstein condensates set as gravitons as to composing the early universe black holes.

<div class='title'>Discussion of Cosmological Acceleration and Dark Energy</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/felix_lev">Felix Lev</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The title of this workshop is: "What comes beyond standard models?". Standard models are based on Poincare invariant quantum theory. However, as shown in the famous Dyson's paper "Missed Opportunities" and in my publications, such a theory is a special degenerate case of de Sitter invariant quantum theory. I argue that the phenomenon of cosmological acceleration has a natural explanation as a consequence of quantum de Sitter symmetry in semiclassical approximation. The explanation is based only on universally recognized results of physics and does not involve models and/or assumptions the validity of which has not been unambiguously proved yet (e.g., dark energy and quintessence). I also explain that the cosmological constant problem and the problem why the cosmological constant is as is do not arise.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Introduced and discussed is what is termed the light-speed acceleration radius. This is the radius of a spherical gravitational object at which an object (particle) at rest will accelerate to the speed of light in the Planck time. Because the Planck time is likely the shortest possible time interval and the speed of light is the maximum possible speed, this is the radius for the maximum gravitational field as measured by gravitational acceleration. This radius differs from the Schwarzschild radius except for so-called micro black holes.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this article, we present a method for measuring the one-way speed of light, for both flat (euclidean) and curved space (non-euclidean), with subtle differences in approach. So far, there is no solution for measuring the one-way speed of light, but there is for the two-way speed of light, where, in essence, only a mirror is used to reflect light back to where the light began it's journey, assuming that the speed of light is equal in all directions (which may not be true, according to Einstein).</div>

<div class='title'>Our Collapsing Friedman Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/william_q_sumner">William Q. Sumner</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 1907 using special relativity, Albert Einstein proved that vacuum permittivity, &#949;, changes in accelerating coordinate reference frames. &#949; is the scalar in Maxwell&#8217;s equations that determines the speed of light and the strength of electrical fields. In 1952, M&#248;ller confirmed Einstein&#8217;s discovery by proving that &#949; is a function of the curvature of static spacetimes. In 1994, Sumner proved that &#949; changes with the curvature of Friedmann spacetime. Photon energies are proportional to &#949;, but the energies of photons emitted by atoms are proportional to &#949;^2. This difference reverses the interpretation of Hubble redshifts. Hubble redshifts only result when a Friedmann universe is collapsing. This is confirmed by the Pantheon redshift data fit of 1048 supernovas with a negative Hubble constant Ho =-72.10&#177;0.75 km s&#8722;1 Mpc&#8722;1 and a deceleration parameter 1/2 &lt; q_o &lt; 0.51. The velocity of light in Friedmann geometry is inversely proportional to the radius of the universe. The velocity of light was infinite at the Big Bang and decreased to zero at maximum size when the universe began to collapse. The velocity of light is now accelerating towards infinity. Its current value is c. Collapse will be complete in 9.05 billion years. The current age of the universe is estimated to be 1.54 x 10^4 billion years.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Relativity of the Speed of Light</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/x_d_dongfang">X. D. Dongfang</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Einstein's assumption that the speed of light is constant is a fundamental principle of modern physics with great influence. However, the nature of the principle of constant speed of light is rarely described in detail in the relevant literatures, which leads to a deep misunderstanding among some readers of special relativity. Here we introduce the unitary principle, which has a wide application prospect in the logic self consistency test of mathematics, natural science and social science. Based on this, we propose the complete space-time transformation including the Lorentz transformation, clarify the definition of relative velocity of light and the conclusion that the relative velocity of light is variable, and further prove that the relative variable light speed is compatible with Einstein's constant speed of light. The specific conclusion is that the propagation speed of light in vacuum relative to the observer's inertial reference frame is always constant c, but the propagation speed of light relative to any other inertial reference frame which has relative motion with the observer is not equal to the constant c; observing in all inertial frame of reference, the relative velocity of light propagating in the same direction in vacuum is 0, while that of light propagating in the opposite direction is 2c. The essence of Einstein's constant speed of light is that the speed of light in an isolated reference frame is constant, but the relative speed of light in vacuum is variable. The assumption of constant speed of light in an isolated frame of reference and the inference of relative variable light speed can be derived from each other.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/miquel_pinol">Miquel Pi&#241;ol</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>From the perspective of a distant observer, a free-falling body in the Schwarzschild metric would require an infinite time to reach the Schwarzschild radius, whereas a comoving observer would measure just a finite interval of proper time along that path. This paradoxical situation is commonly interpreted considering the perspective of the distant observer as a simple &#8220;artifact&#8221; due to the enormous delay of the light signals emitted by the free-falling body during its fall, &#8220;already&#8221; completed. This interpretation of relativistic mechanics is intrinsically inconsistent, as shown in this article. We propose an alternative elucidation based on the analogy between the asymptotic trajectory of a free-falling body approaching the horizon event of a Schwarzschild black hole and an accelerated body exponentially asymptotically tending to the speed of light in Special Relativity.</div>

<div class='abstract'>It is hypothesized that the refractive index of moving gases in their rest frame becomes anisotropic.

The hypothesis is tested against historical data from Dayton C. Miller's experiments on Mount Wilson in 1925&#8211;1926. A suitable signal is found in selected data, confirming the aether theory. Using curve fitting, the speed v and the apex, in equatorial coordinates (&#945;, &#948;), of the motion of the solar system in the aether were determined. The smallest deviation of the theory from the data results with the parameters v = (326 &#177; 17) km/s, &#945; = (11.0 &#177; 0.2) h, &#948; = (-11 &#177; 5)&#176;.</div>

<div class='title'>Quaternion Space-Time and Matter</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/viktor_ariel">Viktor Ariel</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this work, we use the key assumption that division algebras play a key role in description and prediction of natural phenomena. Consequently, we use division algebra of quaternions to describe the four-dimensional space-time intervals. Then, we demonstrate that the quaternion space-time together with the finite speed of signal propagation allow for a simple, intuitive understanding of the space-time interval transformation during arbitrary motion between a signal source and observer. We derive a quaternion form of the Lorentz time dilation and suggest that it's real scalar norm is the traditional form of the Lorentz transformation, representing experimental measurements of the space-time interval. Thus, the new quaternion theory is inseparable from the experimental process. We determine that the space-time interval in the observer reference frame is given by a conjugate quaternion expression, which is essential for a proper definition of quaternion gradient operator. Then, we apply the quaternion gradient to an arbitrary quaternion potential function, which leads to the unified expressions of force fields. The second quaternion differentiation results in the unified Maxwell equations. Finally, we apply the resulting unified formalism to electromagnetic and gravitational interactions and show that the new expressions are similar to the traditional equations, with the novel terms related to scalar fields and velocity dependent components. Furthermore, we obtain two types of force fields and four types of matter density expressions, which require further theoretical and experimental study. Therefore, the new mathematical framework based on quaternion algebra and quaternion calculus may serve as the foundation for a unified theory of space-time and matter, leading to a useful enhancement of the traditional theories of special and general relativity.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The escape velocity derived from general relativity coincides with the Newtonian one. However, the Newto- nian escape velocity can only be a good approximation when v &#8810; c is sufficient to break free of the gravitational field of a massive body as it ignores higher-order terms of the relativistic kinetic energy Taylor series expansion. Consequently, it does not work for a gravitational body with a radius at which v is close to c, such as a black hole. To address this problem, we re-visit the concept of relativistic mass, abandoned by Einstein, and derive what we call a full relativistic escape velocity. This approach leads to a new escape radius where ve = c equal to a half of the Schwarzschild radius. Further, we show that one can derive the Friedmann equation for a critical universe from the escape velocity formula from general relativity theory. We also derive a new equation for a flat universe based on our full relativistic escape velocity formula. Our alternative to the Friedmann formula predicts exactly twice the mass density in our (critical) universe as the Friedemann equation after it is calibrated to the observed cosmological redshift. Our full relativistic escape velocity formula also appears more consistent with the uniqueness of the Planck mass (particle) than the general relativity theory: whereas the general relativity theory predicts an escape velocity above c for the Planck mass at a radius equal to the Planck length, our model predicts an escape velocity c in this case.</div>

Deswegen sollten Interferometer mit Luft im Lichtweg eine Phasenverschiebung messen k&#246;nnen. Das theoretische Signal wird aus der &#196;thertheorie von Lorentz hergeleitet. Die Hypothese wird anhand von historischen Daten der Experimente von Dayton C. Miller auf dem Mount Wilson in den Jahren 1925&#8211;1926 gepr&#252;ft. In ausgew&#228;hlten Daten wird ein passendes Signal gefunden und best&#228;tigt damit die &#196;thertheorie. Mit Hilfe einer Ausgleichsrechnung konnte die Geschwindigkeit v und der Apex, in &#228;quatorialen Koordinaten (&#945;, &#948;), der Bewegung des Sonnensystems im &#196;ther bestimmt werden. Die kleinste Abweichung der Theorie von den Daten ergibt sich mit den Parametern v = (326 &#177; 17) km/s, &#945; = (11,0 &#177; 0,2) h, &#948; = (-11 &#177; 5)&#176;. &lt;p&gt; It is hypothesized that the refractive index of moving gases in their rest frame becomes anisotropic. Therefore interferometers with air in the light path should be able to measure a phase shift. The theoretical signal is derived from Lorentz's aether theory. The hypothesis is tested against historical data from Dayton C. Miller's experiments on Mount Wilson in 1925-1926. A suitable signal is found in selected data, confirming the aether theory. Using curve fitting, the velocity v and the apex, in equatorial coordinates (&#945;, &#948;), of the motion of the solar system in the aether were determined. The smallest deviation of the theory from the data results with the parameters v = (326 &#177; 17) km/s, &#945; = (11.0 &#177; 0.2) h, &#948; = (-11 &#177; 5) &#176;. &lt;p&gt;</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/wanpeng_tan">Wanpeng Tan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A sufficiently massive star in the end of its life will inevitably collapse into a black hole as more deconfined degrees of freedom make the core ever softer. One possible way to avoid the singularity in the end is by dimensional phase transition of spacetime. Indeed, the black hole interior, two-dimensional in nature, can be described well as a perfect fluid of free massless Majorana fermions and gauge bosons under a 2-d supersymmetric mirror model with new understanding of emergent gravity from dimensional evolution of spacetime. In particular, the 2-d conformal invariance of the black hole gives rise to desired consistent results for the interior microphysics and structures including its temperature, density, and entropy.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Here we review Michelson-Morley&#8217;s original analysis of their interferometer experiment and discuss its use of optical distance. We derive a formula for transverse Doppler shift from geometric considerations, apply this to the Michelson-Morley interferometer, and present a phase analysis for the experiment. Furthermore, we present an equation for Doppler shift at a general angle and use this to derive the null phase shift result for round-trip interferometer paths at any arbitrary angle. We do not dispute the validity of the null result, nor the prediction of an arrival-time difference for the transverse and longitudinal arms of the interferometer; rather, we challenge the implicit assumption that an arrival time difference will necessarily result in an observable fringe shift.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/david_l_berkahn">David L. Berkahn</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Working from first principles of special relativity and using a version of the equivalence principle, an hypothesize that an objects mass is a function of its distance to other objects is presented. Further it is posited that there is a correlation between this mass variation and gravitational time dilation in general relativity. Additionally due to the Schwarzschild metric the mass variation also distorts the spatial components of the metric which contributes to gravitational lensing. Hence this approach could be used to explain the unseen mass increase due to gravitational lensing of current dark matter exploration. This leads naturally to the hypothesis of the early rapid clumping in the early universe to produce the &#8216;cosmic web&#8217; and dark matter halos necessary to produce galaxy formation. Certain electrically neutral MACHOS are suggested. These might include possible boson stars or primordial black holes. Radio emission spectrum would also be expected to be higher than average for various dark matter regions. We also expect that the theory is consistent with the observation that not all galaxies exhibit dark matter since not all galaxy clumping originated from the cosmic web. We propose mathematically how the theory can fit naturally with Einsteins field equation. Finally we propose a simple principle for terrestrial measurement of the theory</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/u_kayser-herold">U. Kayser-Herold</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recent analysis of the &quot;Relativistic Ring&quot; problem revealed that its angular momentum features a &quot;paradox&quot; maximum at circumferential velocity $\approx 0,24$ c declining to near zero with increasing velocity. This apparent &quot;paradox&quot; can be resolved by a new approach based on simulated high external forces up to the &quot;Weak Energy Limit&quot; in a low velocity regime $0&lt;v&lt;&lt;c$. Simulations comprise a &quot;Relativitic Rod&quot; in uniform translational motion subjected to a pair of mutually opposed external forces and a pressurized &quot;Relativistic Ring&quot;. If the external forces simulate centrifugal force on a &quot;Relativitic Rod&quot; its canonical momentum features a maximum at velocity $\hat{v} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ c being analogue to the maximum canonical angular momentum of a &quot;Relativistic Ring&quot;. Remarkably, rotational velocity of a pressurized &quot;Relativistic Ring&quot; can be modulated by variation of pressure - at constant canonical angular momentum.\\</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ichiro_tanabe">Ichiro Tanabe</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/riko_ozao">Riko Ozao</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>To provide solutions for the unresolved theoretical questions of black holes, such as the presence of an event horizon, we propose a new spherically symmetric exact solution (we call the Ryskmit (R) solution). The R solution can be obtained by applying Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates (referred to hereinafter as Kruskal coordinates) to the Schwarzchild solution. The R solution has no singularities other than the origin of coordinates and no &#8220;event horizon&#8221;; therefore, a black hole from which information could not be extracted from the outside need not be considered. Far from the origin, this solution is approximately equal to the Schwarzschild solution. Another characteristic of this solution is that the gravity reaches its maximum at the Schwarzschild radius, and at the half of this radius, it transits to Minkowski space, in which gravity does not exist. This means that the gravity gradually decreases with distance from the Schwarzschild radius. Based on the law of conservation of energy, we deduced a result that explains the production of sufficient kinetic energy for gamma-ray burst. Furthermore, the metric of this solution was remarkably similar to the Reissner&#8211;Nordstr&#248;m metric, and the presence and absence of an electrical charge lead to two different masses at the scale of Planck units where the two solutions match. This is an important relationship for answering questions about dark matter. As described above, this exact solution could be a useful basic equation that sheds light not only on astrophysics, but also on particle theory and the unified field theory.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/g_l_harnagel">G. L. Harnagel</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Since the first part of the twentieth century, it has been maintained that faster-than-light motion could produce time travel into the past with its accompanying causality-violating paradoxes. However, there are two different approaches to tachyon communication around a loop, one employs a &quot;hand-off&quot; between momentarily- adjacent observers in relative motion passing each other, while the other applies direct tachyon communication between moving observers who are not adjacent. Tachyon physics in the latter method clearly precludes causality violation, but it is more subtle in the former approach. An analysis of what would be observed in a physics laboratory, rather than what is inferred from a Minkowski diagram, attests that causality violation does not occur in the hand-off method, either. Thus it is demonstrated that tachyons do not violate causality.</div>

It then proposes a consistent solution within the finitist framework of the discrete spacetimes of cellular automata like models, proving the factor that convert between continuum and discrete spacetimes has the algebraic form of the relativistic factor of Lorentz transformation, which could be reinterpreted as an operator to translate between a consistent discrete reality and an inconsistent continuous reality.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/risto_raitio">Risto Raitio</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The focus of this note is in the formation of matter-antimatter asymmetric universe without antimatter in the first place. To avoid problems of best known published preon models we utilize &#180;t Hooft theory&#8217;s deterministic Hilbert space methods to preons. Inflation is started in a ultra dense graviton phase predominating the very early universe and producing supersymmetric preons, axion like particles and torsion in spacetime. All standard model and dark sector fermions are created as spectators during early inflation from the preons. The dark sector particles are spectators all the way beyond reheating while the visible sector particles couple to the inflaton. Before reheating is reached supersymmetry is broken to the minimal supersymmetric standard model by gravitational mediation from the preon sector. Consequently, asymmetric visible matter, symmetric dark matter and dark energy are produced, and much later nucleons and light nuclei are formed. The deterministic preon level structure is necessary for the mechanism which creates from C symmetric preons the asymmetric standard model visible matter directly, without notable amount of antimatter and without the Sakharov conditions.</div>

It also proves a contradiction involving the actual infinity hypothesis on which the spacetime continuum is grounded. The alternative of a discrete spacetime is then considered, and the consideration leads, via Pythagoras digital theorem, to the conclusion that the factor for converting between continuous and digital geometries is the relativistic Lorentz factor if length is replaced with the product of speed and time in a isotropic space.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/christian_corda">Christian Corda</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is shown through three different approaches that, contrary to a longstanding conviction older than 160 years, the orbit of Mercury behaves as required by Newton's equations with a very high precision if one correctly analyzes the situation in the framework of the two-body problem without neglecting the mass of Mercury. General relativity remains more precise than Newtonian physics, but the results in this paper show that Newtonian framework is more powerful than researchers and astronomers were thinking till now, at least for the case of Mercury. The Newtonian formula of theadvance of planets' perihelion breaks down for the other planets. The predicted Newtonian result is indeed too strong for Venus and Earth. Therefore, it is also shown that corrections due to gravitational and rotational time dilation, in an intermediate framework which analyzes gravity between Newton and Einstein, solve the problem. By adding such corrections, a result consistent with the one of general relativity is indeed obtained. Thus, the most important results of this paper are two: i) It is not correct that Newtonian theory cannot predict the anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of planets' orbit. The real problem is instead that a pure Newtonian prediction is too strong. ii) Perihelion's precession can be achieved with the same precision of general relativity by extending Newtonian gravity through the inclusion of gravitational and rotational time dilation effects. This second result is in agreement with a couple of recent and interesting papers of Hansen, Hartong and Obers. Differently from such papers, in the present work the importance of rotational time dilation is also highlighted.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Since the beginning of human history, the way of thinking about time has changed with the times. Various concepts of time existed for a time according to religions and philosophies, but in the late 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton's (1643-1727) concept of &quot;absolute space and time&quot; spread. Later, special relativity proposed by Albert Einstein (1879-1955) at the beginning of the 20th century made it clear that this was not the case. However, if one process is added after the paradox that is emerging in special relativity, we get a result that indicates the existence of absolute time. Therefore, I present the need to rethink the concept of &quot;time&quot; again.</div>

However, this paper reveals that the Lorentz&#8217;s application of both transformations to derive the electromagnetic wave equation for two inertial reference frames is logically flawed. This logical mistake makes the superiority of Lorentz transformation questionable. The paper also demonstrates that both Lorentz and Galilean transformations can generate standard equations for electromagnetic waves, while both cannot keep the transformed Maxwell&#8217;s equations consistent. Since the relativity theory is based on the belief that the Lorentz transformation can keep physics law in the same form for different reference frames, the findings of this paper have important implications: Either the relativity theory is not one hundred percent correct or our understanding of the theory needs updating in light of the new knowledge</div>

<div class='abstract'>We have used the concept of De Broglie's matter wave associated with particles to derive a inverse square law of gravitation like the new-ton's law of gravitation at the plank's length with a slight modification. Obtaining the Newtonian form we have further extrapolated it to formulate Einstein's field equation, which generally is embedded with a slight modification.The Schwarzschild solution is calculated from the modified field equation, which gives us the Schwarzschild radius of a miniature black hole. Using the solution, the entropy and the hawking temperature is also modeled theoretically for the miniature black hole at the plank's order.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A parity symmetry can be established between any pair of identical clocks. The rest frames of each clock can also form a parity symmetry. The time of each rest frame is independent of the direction of the motion of each clock. The elapsed time is identical for both rest frames. Consequently, the elapsed time is conserved in all reference frames. Conservation of elapsed time is a property of parity symmetry.</div>

<div class='abstract'>My MOND proposal includes General Relativity as a special case, i.e. I have effects of General Relativity in many areas of spacetime. I argue that my proposal can describe Dark Matter as well if one understands the modification of gravity as a tensor field X^{\mu\nu}(t,x,y,z) in the Einstein equations, i.e. as an additional mathematical parameter filling the Universe without correspondence to new particles. Notably, there are many different fields in nature, e.g. the Higgs field, the inflaton field, and the temperature distribution field T(t,x,y,z). My testable prediction that they will never find weakly interacting Dark Matter particles is well-realized up to today; therefore, Popper's falsifiability criterion is satisfied because the underground detectors could report the signal. On the other hand, the testable proof would be the indirect discovery of the sterile neutrino. As it does not interact with visible matter even weakly, it is an example of X^{\mu\nu}. This justified theory, applied to key problems of Physics, provides satisfactory answers.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A relativistic composition of gravitational redshift can be implemented using the Volterra product integral. Using this composition as a model, expressions are developed for gravitational potential energy, escape velocity, and a metric. Each of these expressions alleviates a perceived defect in its conventional counterpart. Unlike current theory, relativistic gravitational potential energy would be limited to rest energy (Machian), escape velocity resulting from the composition would be limited to the speed of light, and the associated metric would be singularity-free. These ideal properties warrant investigation, at a foundational level, into relativistic compositions based on product integration.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The acceptance of the multiverse by prominent cosmologists opens the door to exploring alternative solutions to Einstein's field equations. This brief paper explores the mathematics of an alternative solution in which it is postulated that d&tau; physically behaves differently than it does in the FLRW cosmology (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, d&tau;=a(t)dt as opposed to the FLRW's d&tau;=dt).&nbsp; The equations that are analogous to the Friedmann equations contain an additional a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term, and the equation that is analogous to the Friedmann acceleration equation has a change in sign. The age-based a(t)=t/t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; solution to these equations results in an Einstein variable gravity model in which the cosmological constant (&Lambda;) discrepancy is resolved. The analogs to the Friedmann equations, when evaluated between the Planck era and t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; effectively reduce to the same expression as the calculation of the vacuum Zero-point energy, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; &Omega;&lt;sub&gt;&Lambda;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ramses_bounkeu_safo">Rams&#232;s Bounkeu Safo</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Gravity is the most problematic interaction of modern science. Our current understanding of gravitation as a spacetime curvature needs the introduction of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy accounting for 95\% of the energy of the universe. Questioning the very foundations of gravity might be the key to understanding it better since its description changed over time. Newton described it as a force, Einstein described it as a spacetime curvature and this paper shows how gravity can be described as a force able to bend spacetime instead. Based on a physical interpretation of the Schwarzschild metric, this approach yields the same predictions as General Relativity such as Mercury&#8217;s Perihelion Precession, Light Bending, Time Dilation and Gravitational Waves as well as predicted testable deviations from General Relativity. Applying this description of gravity to cosmology accounts for the accelerating expanding universe with no need for Dark Energy. Described as a spacetime bending force, gravity becomes quantizable as a force in a curved spacetime which is compatible with the Standard Model of particle physics. Therefore, one could adapt the Lagrangian of the Standard Model to this theory to achieve Quantum Gravity.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We examine the associated wave of the electron, and we put in evidence the problem with its relative velocity. The velocity of an electron is always measured relative to the laboratory, which gives the correct behaviour of the electron relative to the law of Louis de Broglie. But, to agree with this law, there must exist some interaction between the electron and the laboratory, which allows the electron to modify its characteristics. The electron must therefore interact with a media connected to the laboratory. Such a media must be associated with the earth, following it in its path through the Universe. It follows that the relativity theories of A. Einstein are wrong.</div>

The existence of nodes in all reference frames requires the wavelength of the microwave to be conserved in all inertial reference frames.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The velocity of a wave depends on the choice of reference frame. The relative motion between the rest frames of the wave source, the observer, and the wave determines the apparent wavelength and apparent period in each rest frame. The apparent period is different from the original period unless the wave source and the observer occupy the same rest frame. The apparent wavelength is identical to the original wavelength unless the relative motion between the wave source and the wave is non-inertial. The observed wavelength is identical to all observers. A time varying wavelength is an indication that a remote star is in non-inertial motion during star birth. The inertial force corresponding to the non-inertial relative motion between the rest frames can not be identified as any fundamental force. A neutral object in the non-inertial motion is not attracted by electric force. The massless microwave in the non-inertial reference frame is not attracted by gravitational force.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dongkui_tan">Dongkui Tan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The special relativity (SR) is proposed based on the Lorentz transformation (LT) which points out the relationship between space and time. However, the LT intuitively assumes that the different dimensions in space are independent, i.e., the motion of a body in x-direction doesn't affect its position change in y-direction. By considering the correlation between spatial dimensions, a novel and elegant space-time transformation is deduced based on the principle of constant speed of light. The new transformation not only indicates traditional relativistic effects, but also reveals a new one, called as transverse dilatation. More importantly, the transformation suggests that the full universe could be a four-dimensional complex space-time with extra mirror universe. Subsequently, several fundamental and challenging physics problems are reasonably explained, such as the nature of electromagnetic waves, the spooky quantum entanglement, the ghostly dark matter(DM) and the center of black hole.</div>

<div class='title'>A Causally Connected Superluminal Natario Warp Drive Spacetime ???</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However one the major drawbacks concerning warp drives is the problem of the Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime) in which an observer in the center of the bubble cannot signal nor control the front part of the bubble.The geometrical features of the Natario warp drive are the required ones to overcome this obstacle at least in theory. The behavior of a photon sent to the front of the warp bubble in the case of a Natario warp drive with variable velocity is the main purpose of this work.We present the behavior of a photon sent to the front of the bubble in the Natario warp drive in the $1+1$ spacetime with both constant and variable velocities using quadratic forms and the null-like geodesics $ds^2=0$ of General Relativity and we provide here the step by step mathematical calculations in order to outline the final results found in our work which are the following ones: For the case of fixed velocities the Horizon exits in agreement with the current scientific literature but for the case of variable velocities the Horizon do not exists at all.Due to the extra terms in the Natario vector that affects the whole spacetime geometry this solution with variable velocities have different results when compared to the fixed velocity solution.Remember that we are presenting our results using step by step mathematics in order to better illustrate our point of view.</div>

<div class='title'>The Photon Existence Paradox</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/armin_nikkhah_shirazi">Armin Nikkhah Shirazi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Special relativity enjoins lightspeed objects from possessing essential characteristics one might naively associate with physically existing objects. Thus, it can be argued, had we not already known of the physical existence of lightspeed objects, such as photons, then we would have interpreted this enjoinment to mean that it is impossible for lightspeed objects to exist. From this perspective, the empirical existence of photons poses a paradox. A recently proved equivalence relation shows how this paradox is properly resolved: it is possible for lightspeed objects to exist, but not in spacetime. The interpretation of the paradox depends on which aspect of special relativity one wishes to emphasize: it can be framed either in terms of the ``error'' of assuming absolute existence, i.e. that physical existence can be specified without reference to a given spacetime, or a ``gap'' in standard special relativity in that it lacks any reference to a physics-based concept of existence in spacetime.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper shows that a simple and relativistic extension of Newtonian gravity leads to predictions that fits super- nova observations of magnitude versus redshift very well without having to rely on the hypothesis of dark energy. In order to test the concept, we look at 580 supernova data points from the Union2 database. Some relativistic extensions of Newtonian gravity have been investigated in the past, but we have reason to believe the efforts were rejected prematurely, before their full potential was investigated. Our model suggests that mass, as related to gravity, is also affected by standard relativistic velocity effects, something that is not the case in standard gravity theory, and this adjustment gives su- pernova predictions that fit the observations. Our find- ings are reflected in several recent research papers that follow the same approach; that work will also will be dis- cussed in this paper.</div>

However, in this paper we show that the standard model may not be as far off as previously believed. By taking into account that gravity has an infinite extent in space and assessing the assumed mass in the observable universe, we get a minimum acceleration that gives a much closer match to observed galaxy rotations than would be expected. We will discuss whether or not this is enough to overturn the long-standing perspective on the standard model and if it could indeed provide a possible and adequate explanation of galaxy rotations.</div>

<div class='abstract'>New physics and models for the most compact astronomical objects - neutron / quark stars and black holes are proposed. Under the new supersymmetric mirror models, neutron stars at least heavy ones could be born from hot deconfined quark matter in the core with a mass limit less than $2.5 M_\odot$. Even heavier cores will inevitably collapse into black holes as quark matter with more deconfined quark flavors becomes ever softer during the staged restoration of flavor symmetry. With new understanding of gravity as mean field theories emergent from the underlying quantum theories for providing the smooth background spacetime geometry for quantum particles, the black hole interior can be described well as a perfect fluid of free massless Majorana fermions and gauge bosons under the new genuine 2-d model. In particular, the conformal invariance on a 2-d torus for the black hole gives rise to desired consistent results for the interior microphysics and structures including its temperature, density, and entropy. Conjectures for further studies of the black hole and the early universe are also discussed in the new framework.</div>

The influences go back to humans&#8217; primitive concepts of an unmoving Earth, whose modern incarnations are embodied by Albert Einstein&#8217;s &#8220;relativistic&#8221; principles. An imaginary alien (Rotonian) perspective is adopted, whereby these ancient Earthian predilections are all questioned. Even the (3 + 1)-dimensionality of space is questioned. When Rotonians visit an astronomical body for the first time, their instinctive belief in accelerometer readings leads them to a gravitational hypothesis (Space Generation Model) according to which matter is the source of space. They conceive the essence of gravity as the process whereby matter regenerates itself and creates new space. They conceive the process as the outward motion OF space into a fourth spatial dimension; matter is thus seen as an inexhaustible source of perpetual propulsion. It is this stationary motion that causes the curvature of spacetime. The hypothesis is developed in detail with respect to local physics and a chart is plotted for a more in depth application to cosmological issues, as promised for Part 2. It is repeatedly urged that, of much greater importance than discussing these issues, is the need to at last do Galileo&#8217;s experiment.</div>

<div class='title'>Einstein Dual Theory of Relativity</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper is a comparison of the Minkowski, Einstein and Einstein dual theories of relativity. The dual is based on an identity relating the observer time and the proper time as a contact transformation on configuration space, which leaves phase space invariant. The theory is dual in that, for a system of n particles, any inertial observer has two unique sets of global variables (X, t) and (X, &#964;) to describe the dynamics. Where X is the (unique) canonical center of mass. In the (X, t) variables, time is relative and the speed of light is unique, while in the (X, &#964; ) variables, time is unique and the speed of light is relative with no upper bound. The two sets of particle and Maxwell field equations are mathematically equivalent, but the particle wave equations are not. The dual version contains an additional longitudinal radiation term that appears instantaneously with acceleration and we predict that radiation from a betatron (of any frequency) will not produce photoelectrons. The theory does not depend on the nature of the force and the Wheeler- Feynman absorption hypothesis becomes a corollary. The homogeneous and isotropic nature of the universe is sufficient to prove that a unique definition of Newtonian time exists with zero set at the big bang. The isotopic dual of R is used to improve the big bang model, by providing an explanation for the lack of antimatter in our universe, a natural arrow for time, conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum. This also solves the flatness and horizon problems without inflation. We predict that matter and antimatter are gravitationally repulsive and that experimental data from distant sources cannot be given a unique physical interpretation. We provide a table showing the differences between the Minkowski, Einstein and dual versions of the special theory.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We review the Thomas precession exhibiting the exact form of the Thomas rotation in the axis-angle parameterization. Assuming three inertial frames $S, S', S''$ moving with arbitrary velocities and with $S, S''$ having their axis parallel to the axis of $S'$ we focus our attention on the two essential elements of the Thomas precession e.g., (i) there is a rotation between the axis of frames $S$, $S''$ and (ii) the combination of two Lorentz transformations from $S$ to $S'$ and from $S'$ to $S''$ fails to produce a pure Lorentz transformation from $S$ to $S''$. The physical consequence of (i) and (ii) refers to the impossibility of having arbitrary frames $S, S', S''$ moving with their axis mutually parallel. Then, we reexamine the validity of (i) and (ii) under the conjecture the time depends on the state of motion of the frames and we show that the Thomas precession assumes a different form as formulated in (i) and (ii).</div>

<div class='title'>Half Truths and Rant Against ECO Paradigm by Chandra Prakash</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/abhas_mitra">Abhas Mitra</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>One Chandra Pakash of unknown affiliation has publised his maiden preprint (vixra.org/abs/2001.0501) entitled: ``Abhas Mitra and Eternally Collapsing Objects: A Review of 22 Years of Misconceptions&quot;[1]. Although there are 20 odd peer reviewed journal papers on various aspects of the ECO paradigm Prakash cites only one old paper[2] and claims to have debunked the entire research by Mitra, Leiter, Robertson and Schild spread over almost 15 years. He even uploaded a 9 min youtube video debunking not only ECO paradigm by me as a physicist. Incidentally, he happens to be one my FB friends, and had casually raised a few points. He appeared to be satisfied with my clarifications, and never told me that he had already written a preprint &quot;debunking&quot; the ECO paradigm. While it is likely that one of the 20 odd related papers is invalidated, the results and conclusions behind ECO paradigm remain firmly established by series of independent papers. In fact the conclusion that a collapsing massive star should turn into an ultra-hot ball of magnetized plasma (ECO, MECO) follows from 5 papers: 1 in Physical Review (D), 2 in MNRAS Letters, 1 in MNRAS and 1 in New Astronomy {3,4,5,6,7,8}; and this result is valid irrespective of any mathematical proof for non-existence of finite mass true black holes. Incidentally, the maiden proof that a true mathematical Schwarzschild black hole should have zero gravitational mass was given by L. Bel in 1969 (Bel, JMP 10, 1051, 1969)[9], three decades before I independently suggested the same result.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A number of researchers have employed complex time. If time is complex, it is reasonable to allow the time components of the metric tensor to also be complex. The four imaginary quantities in the metric tensor can be shown to be consistent with the values of the magnetic vector potential. The (four-dimensional complex) line element is then shown to be functionally identical to the Kaluza 5-dimentional line element. The four dimensional (complex) metric therefore inherits the results Kaluza obtained when he included the magnetic vector potential in a ve dimensional metric.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_d_bock">Robert D. Bock</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We introduce a synchronization scheme that reconciles presentism with special relativity. Specifically, we address the challenge of defining in special relativity a global present of an observer at a particular location that is independent of reference frame. This is achieved by postulating that the coordinate time that elapses for light to propagate from emitter to absorber is a fundamental constant of nature and is independent of the separation distance and also independent of the reference frame of the absorber. We show that the proposed theory predicts cosmological redshifts consistent with observation if an asymmetry exists between the emitter's and absorber's perceptions of time.</div>

All the mathematical analysis will be dealt here to conclude the proofs required for ECO paradigm to begin with is ad-hoc. First part in rejecting black holes always considers the possibility of formation of trapped surfaces so we will begin our work by looking into ``non occurrence of trapped surfaces'' then we analyze Dr. Mitra's indirect claim regarding how R = 0 (inside black hole) could also be treated as another coordinate singularity! After that we review if indeed his another claim about ``mass of Schwarzschild black hole being zero'' is right or not. Do black holes really exist or they are just a fairy tale made by physicists to elude us into fiction? And are these so called ``Black Holes'', actually black hole or indeed as Mitra likes to call them ``Eternally Collapsing Object'' or ECO. Are ECOs really a true alternative to Black Holes? The analysis presented here will show us, why ECOs are baseless can not really a solution to black hole problem.</div>

<div class='abstract'>There are controversies on mass-velocity relation and charge of moving electrons, which are related with mass-energy equivalence. Author thought that mass-energy equivalence was expressing the energy relation of bodies and space as mass. In this paper author proposed relative kinetic energy $E_{rk}=mv^2$ to explain this relation. With relative kinetic energy theory, author inferred the equations for mass-energy equivalence and mass-velocity relation. While analyzing the electron acceleration movement, author found the reasons for the two unreal equation of mass-velocity relation, and determined the equations of mass-velocity relation and charge-velocity relation of electrons. These determinations are of important significance for relativity theory and electrodynamics, even for superconducting research. [eastear@outlook.com, eastear@163.com]</div>

The light reflected by the corner cube interferes with another light from the same emission. The interference pattern can not be explained by the theory if the speed of light remains constant upon reflection. Two research teams were obliged to propose new definition of acceleration to match their test data. Neither team understands that the speed of light actually changes upon reflection by a moving mirror. The definition of acceleration should remain intact. The speed of reflected light should increase to match the observed fringe pattern from the gravimeter.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chan_rasjid_kah_chew">Chan Rasjid Kah Chew</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Despite E= mc&#178; being a foundational equation of modern physics, it has not been experimentally verified. Though four eminent physicists claimed &#8216;A direct test of E=mc&#178;&#8217; (Nature 2006) giving verification accurate to 1:10&#8310;, the experiment was not any verification of E=mc&#178;, but rather an alternative experiment to deduce the mass of the neutron. Instead of the usual Deuteron interaction, they used the nuclear interaction involving sulfur S-32 and silicon Si-28. The claim of accuracy of 1:10&#8310; is about the comparison of the new value with the accepted value of the mass of the neutron. This paper shows that a chemical analysis (with a good analytical balance) of the mass composition of oxygen and hydrogen in plain distilled water may show that the law of conservation of mass is universally valid without the need for the hypothesis of mass-energy equivalence; this would also imply an unequivocal refutation of the equation E=mc&#178;. Such an experiment could easily be carried out by any laboratory in today&#8217;s universities. The experiment should be simple and straightforward, yet its outcome may have enormous consequences for the world of physics.</div>

<div class='title'>Wave Pulse Theory Of Light (WPTOL) Based On Bohr Model</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chan_rasjid_kah_chew">Chan Rasjid Kah Chew</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Bohr Model is an alternative theory of light to Maxwell's theory. It is extended to a wave pulse theory of light, WPTOL. It is a classical aether theory. When an orbital electron of an atom makes a quantum jump to a lower energy state, it emits a single polarization wave pulse of one wavelength in the aether. There is no neutron in the nucleus of the atom in the `Simple Unified Theory', SUT; the neutron is replaced with a proton and an nuclear electron. As the nucleus of the atom has only proton and electron, WPTOL covers the emission of gamma-rays originating from the nucleus of the atom. The binding energy within the nucleus is also the Coulomb electric force; there is no strong force. All radiation consist of single wavelength wave pulses and the wave pulses are all separate wave entities;there is no `train of light waves' in WPTOL. The train of light waves as found in Maxwell's theory has no physical basis. A light wave pulse has energy E=h&#957; and momentum P=E/c, the same energy and momentum relation of the relativistic photon. It is this single wave pulse of one wavelength that gives the illusion of light as particle. WPTOL eliminates the `wave particle duality' hypothesis for light. The theoretical value of light speed in the aether is c=m_e e&#8308; /(8&#949;&#8320;h&#179;R), R being the Rydberg constant. Newton's first law is extended to a light wave pulse in the aether which explains why light propagates in a straight line. There is no dissipation of energy of a wave pulse as it propagates in the aether. WPTOL does not need the concept of magnetism. The WPTOL is a much stronger theory of light as compared to the Maxwell's theory.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this work, we study the polytropic gas (PG) cosmology in a d-dimensional (dD) form of the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) framework. In this context, we focus on the evolution of the corresponding energy density as a first step. Next, we use the most recent data from the Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia), observational values of the cosmic Hubble parameter (OHD) and the updated Planck-results to place constraints on the free parameters defined in the model. We show that the 5D form of the scenario is more compatible with the recent observations. Moreover, according to the best values of the auxiliary parameters, we compte age of the cosmos theoretically.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We mainly study a cosmological scenario represented by the variable Polytropic gas (VPG) unified energy density proposal. To reach this aim, we start with reconstructing a variable form of the original Polytropic gas (OPG) definition. We show that this model is a generalization of the OPG, cosmological constant plus cold dark matter (&#923;CDM) and two different Chaplygin gas models. Later, we fit the auxiliary parameters given in the model and discuss essential cosmological features of the VPG proposal. Besides, we compare the VPG with the OPG by focusing on recent observational dataset given in literature including Planck 2018 results. We see that the VPG model yields better results than the OPG description and it fits very well with the recent experimental data. Moreover, we discuss some thermodynamical features of the VPG and conclude that the model describes a thermodynamically stable system.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We investigate cosmological features of the variable Chaplygin gas (VCG) describing a unified dark matter-energy scenario in a universe governed by the five dimensional (5D) Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. In such a proposal, the VCG evolves as from the dust-like phase to the phantom or the quintessence phases. It is concluded that the background evolution for the KK type VCG definition is equivalent to that for the dark energy interacting with the dark matter. Next, after performing neo-classical tests, we calculated the proper, luminosity and angular diameter distances. Additionally, we construct a connection between the VCG in the KK universe and a homogenous minimally coupled scalar field by introducing its self-interacting potential and also we confirm the stability of the KK type VCG model by making use of thermodynamics. Moreover, we use data from Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia), observational H(z) dataset (OHD) and Planck-2015 results to place constraints on the model parameters. Subsequently, according to the best-fit values of the model parameters we analyze our results numerically.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the present work, we mainly discuss the variable polytropic gas (VPG henceforth) proposal, which is describing a self-gravitating gaseous sphere and can be considered as a crude approximation for realistic stellar denitions, from a caloric perspective. In order to reach this aim, we start with reconstructing the VPG model by making use of thermodynamics. And then, the auxiliary parameters written in the proposal are tted by focusing on updated experimental dataset published in literature. We also discuss the model in view of the statistical perspective and conclude that the caloric VPG model (cVPG henceforth) is in good agreement with the recent astrophysical observations. With the help of the statistical discussions, we see that the cVPG model is suitable for the statistical cosmology and can be used to make useful predictions for the future of the universe via the machine learning (ML henceforth) methods like the linear regression (LR henceforth) algorithm. Moreover, according to the results, we also perform a rough estimation for the lifetime of the universe and conclude that the cosmos will be torn apart after 51Gyr which means our universe has spent 21 percent of its lifetime.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The conservation of mass in inertial reference frame is a property of the conservation law of momentum. The inelastic collision between two identical objects shows that the total momentum is zero in the COM frame (center of mass). In another inertial reference frame, the rest frame of one object before collision, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This conservation of momentum shows that the mass of an object is also conserved in all inertial reference frames. The mass of a moving object is independent of its velocity.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/vincenzo_peluso">Vincenzo Peluso</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A new cosmological model is presented, which derives from a new physics within a theory of everything. It introduces, beyond radiation and baryonic matter, a unique and new ingredient, which is the substance of the universe, and which can be assimilated to the cold dark matter of the standard cosmology. The new model, although profoundly different from the &Lambda;CDM model, exhibits the same metric and an almost identical distance scale. So it shares the same chronology and the same theory of nucleosynthesis, but solves the problem of the horizon, the fatness of space and the homogeneity of the distribution of matter in a natural way, without having to resort to an additional theory like that of inflation and without dark energy. Eventually it resolves the tension between the direct and the inverse cosmic distance ladder.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Wang, Zheng, and Yao carried out an experiment in 2004 to determine if the Sagnac effect can be applied to the inertial motion. Their experiment showed that there was indeed phase difference between the two light beams passing through the same optical fiber in inertial motion. However, the focus of their experiment was on the rest frame of the light source. They did not realize that the time difference from the phase difference should exist in all reference frames. The difference in the elapsed time taken by two light beams to pass through the linear fiber segment in the rest frame of the segment effectively corresponds to the speed difference between two light beams. The Sagnac effect in inertial motion provides a precise experimental evidence that the speed of light is different in a different reference frame.</div>

There are modern experiments done in the laboratories of today&#8217;s universities to verify Compton scattering with &#947;-ray sources from radionuclides where the energies of the rays are measured with NaI scintillation detectors or germanium detectors. Such experiments are shown to be invalid as the result that shows clear agreement with the theory is all due to the calibration of the detectors and nothing besides. Furthermore, a verification that the inverse of energy 1/E varying linearly with (1 &#8722; cos &#952;) is insufficient as a verification of the full Compton scattering formula for wavelength changes. A proper verification requires verifying the wavelength formula where the wavelength is measured directly.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Since the first part of the twentieth century, it has been maintained that faster-than-light motion could produce time travel into the past with its accompanying causality-violating paradoxes. Part of the problem is that the Lorentz transformation (LT) presumes that time is isotropic, as does the Minkowski diagram based upon it, whereas entropy and the arrow of time govern in the real world. This paper demonstrates that time travel into the past and causality violation occur only when speeds &quot;greater than&quot; infinity are involved, and this absurdity is refuted by studying relativistic dynamics in certain scenarios that purportedly lead to causality violation and allowing it to instruct us in limiting the LT in certain other scenarios. Thus there is no justification for the block universe concept and the implication that the past is &quot;back there somewhere&quot; and can be accessed from the present, thus preventing causality paradoxes.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The conservation of the interference pattern from double slit interference proves that the wavelength is conserved in all inertial reference frames. However, there is a popular belief in modern astronomy that the wavelength can be changed by the choice of reference frame. This erroneous belief results in the problematic prediction of the radial speed of galaxy. The reflection symmetry shows that the elapsed time is conserved in all inertial reference frames. From both conservation properties, the velocity of the light is proved to be different in a different reference frame. This different velocity was confirmed by lunar laser ranging test at NASA in 2009. The relative motion between the light source and the light detector bears great similarity to the magnetic force on a moving charge. The motion changes the interference pattern but not the wavelength in the rest frame of the star. This is known as the blueshift or the redshift in astronomy. The speed of light in the rest frame of the grism determines how the spectrum is shifted. Wide Field Camera 3 in Hubble Space Telescope provides an excellent example on how the speed of light can change the spectrum.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The v in the Lorentz transformation is the velocity of the origin of the second frame of reference. A point with no dimensions. From this v we cannot conclude a maximum speed (or anything) for physical objects. The c is the velocity of information. We can choose c to be any value and we see that that chosen value of c is measured the same in both reference frames. Then the speed of light is not a special case. The Lorentz transformation is an approximation of the Galileo transformation in which information has velocity c = &#8734;. The Galileo transformation is 'real-time'. We thereby consider a (absolute) frame of reference from any point in the universe. We can not establish absence of movement and we do not have information traveling at infinite velocity. Therefore the Lorentz transformation is our best approximation of the Galileo transformation and thus of reality.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The observation of spectral shift in astronomy bears great similarity to the frequency shift in the Doppler effect. Both blueshift and redshift can be described by the movement of the double-slit interference. In the rest frame of the star, the light passes through the slit to travel a straight path to reach the projection screen. The intersection of this path and the screen determines how the spectrum is shifted. If the screen moves away from the path, the spectrum will be shifted away from the center of the screen. This is known as redshift. If the screen moves toward the path, the spectrum will be shifted toward the center of the screen. This is known as blueshift. The spectrum not only shifts in position but also resizes proportionally. The spectral shift is caused by the motion of earth in the rest frame of the star while the wavelength of the star light remains constant. The redshift places a maximum limit on the radial velocity of the remote galaxy. The galaxy can not be detected if the earth moves faster than the light in the rest frame of the galaxy. This is dark galaxy.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The observation of spectral shift in astronomy arises from the relative motion between the observed star and the earth. Both blueshift and redshift can be explained with the relative movement of the double-slit interference. In the rest frame of the star, the light passes through the slit to travel a straight path to reach the projection screen. The intersection of this path and the screen is shifted by the movement of the screen. If the screen moves away from the path, the spectrum will be shifted away from the center of the screen. This is known as redshift. If the screen moves toward the path, the spectrum will be shifted toward the center of the screen. This is known as blueshift. The spectrum not only shifts in position but also expands in size. The spectral shift is the result of the relative motion between the projection screen and the path of phase shift. It is not the result of any variation in the wavelength.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The harmonic mode of standing wave requires the number of nodes to be conserved in all inertial reference frames. The half wavelength is proportional to the width of the microwave cavity. The same cavity width is observed by all stationary observers in the same inertial reference frame. All observers observe the same wavelength from the standing wave in a moving cavity. According to the Doppler effect, the observer will detect a higher frequency if the microwave cavity is approaching. The observer will detect a lower frequency if the microwave cavity is receding. With the same wavelength but different frequency, the speed of microwave in the standing wave is different for different observer.</div>

<div class='title'>Speed Of Light From Motion Of Light Source</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The relative motion between a pair of observers represents a reflection symmetry. In the rest frame of first observer, the second observer moves at a distance away. In the rest frame of the second observer, the first observer moves with the same speed at an identical distance away but in the opposite direction. The reflection symmetry shows that the elapsed time in each observer's rest frame is conserved in both rest frames. The light takes the same elapsed time to move between two observers in both rest frames. However, the distance traveled by the light is different in different rest frame. With identical elapsed time but different distance, the speed of light is proved to be different in different reference frame.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The standard cosmological model calculates the gravitational mass-energy contribution of the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) to the mass of the Universe from the single energy density currently observed. The model assumes a homogeneous energy distribution at zero red shift and applies the energy density across the Universe. After reviewing the Friedmann equations for a matter dominated universe and Lematre extension of the space time metric to relativistic energy, we offer an alternative mathematical calculation of the gravitational mass-energy of the CBR component. A complete propagation history of the photons comprising the CBR is used rather than only the current energy density. Because the effects of gravity travel at the speed of light (according to general relativity), and using hot big bang cosmology, we suggest that the higher energy states of the CBR photons in the past also contribute to the currently observed gravitational effects. In our alternative calculation, the CBR energy density is integrated over a range of red shifts in order to account for the gravitational effects of the radiation energy density as it was in the past. By accounting for propagation effects, the resultant gravitational mass-energy calculated for the CBR radiation component almost exactly equals the amount attributed to dark energy. The calculation suggests an extension of the standard cosmological model in which co-moving distance at higher red shift increases with red shift more slowly than it does in the standard model. When compared with Type 1A Supernova data (in an available range of red shift from z = 0.4 to z = 1.5), distance predictions from the extended model have reasonable agreement with observation. The predictions also compare closely with the standard model (up to z = 1.0). Further observations are needed for z &gt; 1.5 to make a final comparison between the standard model and the proposed extended model.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Dark Gravity (DG) is a background dependent bimetric and semi-classical extension of General Relativity with an anti-gravitational sector. The foundations of the theory are reviewed. The main theoretical achievement of DG is the avoidance of any singularities (both black hole horizon and cosmic initial singularity) and an ideal framework to understand the cancellation of vacuum energy contributions to gravity and hopefully solve the old cosmological constant problem. The main testable predictions of DG against GR are on large scales as it provides an acceleration mechanism alternative to the cosmological constant. The detailed confrontation of the theory to SN-Cepheids, CMB and BAO data is presented. The Pioneer effect, MOND phenomenology and Dark Matter are also investigated in the context of this new framework.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The central focus of the theory lies on the solution of the since more than 165 years unsolved problem of turbulence. To achieve this aim the following interstations are reached successfully: 1. definition of a pure continuum corresponding uniquely to a fluid, 2. stochastic turbulent particle transport by a fluctuating continuum, 3. context of deterministic turbulence and its stochastic counterpart in the sense of an ensemble theory. The result turns out to be geometrodynamics: 1. a pure geometrodynamics of turbulence in a 1+3-dimensional Euclidian Space, 2. a pure geometrodynamics of deformation. Both geometrodynmics lead to 1. evolution equations of General Relativity, 2. the quantitative unification of Maxwell Field and Gravitational Field, 3. the facilitation of quantizing gravitational fields, 4. considerations of general gravitational waves from a new perspective. The importance of the Einstein-Equations for microphysics is proved.</div>

<div class='title'>Events Simultaneity and Light Propagation in the Context of the Galilean Principle of Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/attilio_carlo_colombo">Attilio Carlo Colombo</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The intent of this work is to present a discussion of the Galilean Principle of Relativity and of its implications for what concerns the nature of simultaneity of events and the characteristics of light propagation. It is shown that by using a clock synchronization procedure that makes use of isotropically propagating signals of generic nature, the simultaneity of distinct events can be established in a unique way by different observers, also when such observers are in relative motion between themselves. Such absolute nature of simultaneity is preserved in the passage from a stationary to a moving reference frame also when a set of generalized space-time coordinates is introduced. The corresponding transformations of coordinates between the two moving frames can be considered as a generalization of the Lorentz transformations to the case of synchronization signals having characteristic speed different from the speed of light in vacuum. The specific invariance properties of these coordinate transformations with respect to the characteristic speed of propagation of the synchronization signals and of the corresponding constitutive laws of the underlying physical phenomenon are also presented, leading to a different interpretation of their physical meaning with respect to the commonly accepted interpretation of the Lorentz transformations. On the basis of these results, the emission hypothesis of W. Ritz, that assumes that light is always emitted with the same relative speed with respect to its source and that is therefore fully consistent with the Galilean Principle of Relativity, is then applied to justify the outcomes of the Michelson-Morley and Fizeau interferometric experiments by introducing, for the latter case, an additional hypothesis regarding the possible influence of turbulence on the refractive index of the fluid. Finally, a test case to verify the validity of either the Galilean or the Relativistic velocity composition rule is presented. The test relies on the aberration of the light coming from celestial objects and on the analysis of the results obtained by applying the two different formulas for the resultant velocity vector to process the data of the observed positions, as measured by a moving observer, in order to determine the actual un-aberrated location of the source.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>At least one observational study has claimed that Newton's gravitational constant seems to vary with the direction relative to the fixed stars, see [1]. We think this is unlikely, but such experiments should be repeated or at least investigated further. If it is the case that gravity is directionally dependent, then how could this be explained, and how could/should our gravity formulas be modified? In this paper, we introduce an anisotropic big G that is dependent on the direction relative to the fixed stars, and therefore on a given location on Earth, dependent on the Earth's rotation. A series of experiments claim to have found the anisotropic one-way speed of light when getting around Einstein-Poincare synchronization, although they have not received a great deal of attention. We do not question that the one-way speed of light is isotropic when measured with Einstein-Poincare synchronized clocks. We hypothesize here that gravity moves with the speed of light and that the true one-way speed of gravity is anisotropic. Based on this, we get an anisotropic gravitational ``constant,&quot; which, if calibrated to one-way light experiments, is inside two standard deviations of error as given by CODATA.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In special relativity, we operate with length contraction and length transformation; these are not the same thing even though they are related. In addition, we have time dilation and time transformation. However, when it comes to mass, we have only relativistic mass and no mass transformation. We will suggest here, based on a better understanding of mass at the quantum level, that there must also be a Lorentz mass transformation. Recent research strongly indicates that mass is directly linked to the Compton wavelength of the particle in question and since we can operate with both length contraction and length transformation, this means we should have corresponding masses. Length contraction of the Compton wavelength corresponds to what is known today as relativistic mass, while length transformation means we also need mass transformation.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Michelson and Morley carried out an experiment in 1887 to determine if the theory of ether is correct. The experiment shows that the speed of light is constant in all directions. However, an error in this experiment was introduced by the calculation of the elapsed time for light to travel between two moving mirrors in the rest frame of ether. Both Michelson and Morley assumed that the speed of light is not altered upon reflection by a moving mirror. This critical error produced a small variation in the distance traveled by the light between mirrors in the rest frame of ether. As a result, Lorentz transformation was proposed to explain the concept of length contraction.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Recently, anti-de Sitter spaces are used in promising theories of quantum gravity like the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence. The latter provides an approach to string theorie, which includes more than four dimensions. Unfortunately, the anti-de Sitter model contains no mass and is not able to describe our universe adequately. Nevertheless, the rising interest in higherdimensional theories motivates to take a deeper look at the n-dimensional AdS Spacetime. In this paper, a solution of Einstein's field equations is constructed from a modified anti-de Sitter metric in n dimensions. The idea is based on the connection between Schwarzschild- and McVittie metric: McVittie's model, which interpolates between a Schwarzschild Black Hole and an expanding global Friedmann&#8211;Lema&#238;tre&#8211;Robertson&#8211;Walker spacetime, can be constructed by a simple coordinate replacement in Schwarzschild's isotropic intervall, where radial coordinate and it's differential is multiplied by a time dependent scale factor a(t). In a previous work I showed, that an exact solution of Einstein's equations can analogously be generated from a static transformation of de Sitter's metric. The present article is concerned with the application of this method on an AdS (Anti de Sitter) related spacetime in n dimensions. It is shown that the resulting isotropic intervall is a solution of the n-dimensional Einstein equations. Further, it is transformed into a spherical symmetric but anisotropic form, analogously to the transformtion found by Kaloper, Kleban and Martin for McVittie's metric.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We show how one can measure the speed of gravity only using gravitational phenomena. Our approach offers several ways to measure the speed of gravity (light) and checks existing assumptions about light (gravity) in new types of experiments. The speed of light is included in several well-known gravitational formulas. However, if we can measure this speed from gravitational phenomena alone, then is it the speed of light or the speed of gravity we are measuring? We think it is more than a mere coincidence that they are the same. In addition, even if it is not possible to draw strong conclusions now, our formulations support the view that there is a link between electromagnetism and gravity. This paper also shows that all major gravity phenomena can be predicted from only performing two to three light observations. There is no need for knowledge of Newton&#8217;s gravitational constant G or the mass size to complete a series of major gravity predictions.</div>

<div class='title'>Time Coordinate Transformation From Reflection Symmetry</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The application of symmetry to physics leads to conservation law and conserved quantity. For inertial reference frames, the reflection symmetry generates not only conservation but also transformation. Under reflection symmetry, the elapsed time is conserved in all inertial reference frames. The displacement in space is also conserved in all inertial reference frames. From the conservation of the elapsed time and the displacement, the coordinate transformation between inertial reference frame is derived. Based on the coordinate transformation, both the time transformation and the velocity transformation are also derived. The derivation shows that all three transformations are dependent exclusively on the relative motion between inertial reference frames.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the present essay, we consider the origin of the dark energy, cosmological constant and the dark matter. The dark energy, is consequence of the annihilation of the matter - antimatter at the very biginning of the big bang.This dark energy was the origin and cause of the cosmological expansion and the past and present creation of the whole space. We take into account the presence of the call &#8220;dark&#8221; matter as consequence of highly excited hydrogen and helium Ridberg&#8217;s atoms in perfect equilibrium with the CMB radiation. The cosmological constant is considered as an arbitrary ad hoc anti gravitational entity. Finally, we note that the Casimir effect, as a suitable and truly e&#64259;cient physical method and a reliable resource in the experimental determination of the dark energy.</div>

<div class='title'>Better and Deeper Quantum Mechanics! Thoughts on a New Definition of Momentum That Makes Physics Simpler and More Consistent</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We suggest that momentum should be redefined in order to help make physics more consistent and more logical. In this paper, we propose that there is a rest-mass momentum, a kinetic momentum, and a total momentum. This leads directly to a simpler relativistic energy&#8211;momentum relation. As we point out, it is the Compton wavelength that is the true wavelength for matter; the de Broglie wavelength is mostly a mathematical artifact. This observation leads us to a new relativistic wave equation and a new and likely better QM. Further, we show that Minkowski space-time is unnecessarily complex and that a simplified, special case of Minkowski space-time is more consistent with the quantum world. Also, we show how the Heisenberg principle breaks down at the Planck scale, which opens this area of physics up for hidden variable theories once again. Many of the mystical interpretations in modern QM are rooted in the development of an unnecessarily complex theory that drives much speculation and is therefore subject to many different and even conflicting interpretations.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Questions regarding the formation of the Universe and what was there before the existence of Early Universe have been great interest to mankind of all times. In recent decades, the Big Bang as described by the Lambda CDM Standard Model Cosmology has become widely accepted by majority of physics and cosmology communities. Among other things, we can cite A.A. Grib & Pavlov who pointed out some problems of heavy particles creation out of vacuum and also other proposal of Creatio ex nihilo theory (CET). But the philosophical problems remain, as Vaas pointed out: Did the universe have a beginning or does it exist forever, i.e. is it eternal at least in relation to the past? This fundamental question was a main topic in ancient philosophy of nature and the Middle Ages, and still has its revival in modern physical cosmology both in the controversy between the big bang and steady state models some decades ago and in the contemporary attempts to explain the big bang within a quantum cosmological (vacuum &#64258;uctuation) framework. In this paper we argue that Neutrosophic Logic o&#64256;ers a resolution to the long standing disputes between beginning and eternity of the Universe. In other words, in this respect we agree with Vaas, i.e. it can be shown: &#8220;how a conceptual and perhaps physical solution of the temporal aspect of Immanuel Kant&#8217;s &#8221; &#64257;rst antinomy of pure reason&#8220; is possible, i.e. how our universe in some respect could have both a beginning and an eternal existence. Therefore, paradoxically, there might have been a time before time or a beginning of time in time.&#8221; By the help of computational simulation, we also show how a model of early Universe with rotation can &#64257;t this new picture. Further observations are recommended.</div>

<div class='title'>Acceleration Of Radio Wave From Reflection Symmetry</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The reflection symmetry is a physical property for inertial reference frames. It shows that the elapsed time in one inertial reference frame is identical to the elapsed time in another inertial reference frame. The same symmetry also leads to the conservation of the wavelength across inertial reference frames. The velocity of a wave is proportional to its frequency. Doppler effect shows that both the velocity and the frequency depend on the reference frame. The higher the detected frequency is, the faster the wave travels toward the detector. One example is the radar gun used by the traffic police. The reflected radio wave travels faster than the emitted radio wave. This results in frequency difference between two waves. This difference is used to calculate the velocity of a vehicle.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The relative reflection symmetry exists for an isolated system of two stationary persons. The first person sees the second person in a distance away. The second person sees the first person in the same distance away but in the opposite direction. Such symmetry also exists for two mobile persons. Both persons see each other moving at the same speed but in opposite direction in their own rest frames. From the definition of velocity, the time in the rest frame of the first person can be compared to the time in the rest frame of the second person. The result shows that the time in the rest frame of the first person differs from the time in the rest frame of the second person by a constant. Two simultaneous events in one inertial reference frame are also simultaneous in another inertial reference frame.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/francois_ritter">Francois Ritter</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Based on an intuitive generalization of the Lorentz Transformations to non-inertial frames, this study presents new coordinates for a hyperbolically accelerated reference frame. These coordinates are equivalent to the Rindler coordinates exclusively at small times due to the loss of the clock hypothesis. This hypothesis is considered an excellent but fundamentally incorrect approximation for longitudinal motion. The proper acceleration of a hyperbolically accelerated particle is no longer constant and its proper time progressively slows down until becoming constant at the speed of light. This is in agreement with the timeless nature of photons. An event horizon beyond which any information cannot reach the particle is still present and is identical to the Rindler horizon. More importantly, a time dependent factor appears in the metric that could profoundly change our understanding of the space-time dynamic.</div>

<div class='title'>Modified General Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/gary_nash">Gary Nash</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A modified Einstein equation of general relativity is obtained by using the principle of least action, a decomposition of symmetric tensors on a time oriented Lorentzian manifold, and a fundamental postulate of general relativity. The decomposition introduces a new symmetric tensor $ \varPhi_{\alpha\beta} $ which describes the energy-momentum of the gravitational field itself. It completes Einstein's equation and addresses the energy localization problem. The positive part of $ \Phi $, the trace of the new tensor with respect to the metric, describes dark energy. The cosmological constant must vanish and is dynamically replaced by $ \Phi $. A cyclic universe which developed after the Big Bang is described. The dark energy density provides a natural explanation of why the vacuum energy density is so small, and why it dominates the present epoch of the universe. The negative part of $ \Phi $ describes the attractive self-gravitating energy of the gravitational field. $\varPhi_{\alpha\beta} $ introduces two additional terms into the Newtonian radial force equation: the force due to dark energy and the $\frac{1}{r}$ &quot;dark matter&quot; force. When the dark energy force balances the Newtonian force, the flat rotation curves and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation are obtained. The Newtonian rotation curves for galaxies with no flat orbital curves, and those with rising rotation curves for large radii are described as examples of the flexibility of the orbital rotation curve equation.</div>

<div class='title'>Special Relativity Leads to a Trans-Planckian Crisis that is Solved by Haug&#8217;s Maximum Velocity for Matter</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In gravity theory, there is a well-known trans-Planckian problem, which is that general relativity theory leads to a shorter than Planck length and shorter than Planck time in relation to so-called black holes. However, there has been little focus on the fact that special relativity also leads to a trans-Planckian problem, something we will demonstrate here. According to special relativity, an object with mass must move slower than light, but special relativity has no limits on how close to the speed of light something with mass can move. This leads to a scenario where objects can undergo so much length contraction that they will become shorter than the Planck length as measured from another frame, and we can also have shorter time intervals than the Planck time. The trans-Planckian problem is easily solved by a small modification that assumes Haug&#8217;s maximum velocity for matter is the ultimate speed limit for something with mass. This speed limit depends on the Planck length, which can be measured without any knowledge of Newton&#8217;s gravitational constant or the Planck constant. After a long period of slow progress in theoretical physics, we are now in a Klondike &#8220;gold rush&#8221; period where many of the essential pieces are falling in place.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The radio wave changes direction upon reflection. It also changes frequency if it is reflected by a moving surface. In the standing wave formed by the incident wave and the reflected wave, the formation of the nodes requires both waves to have the same wavelength. The nodes exist in all reference frames. This requires both the incident wave and the reflected wave to have the same wavelength in all reference frames. However, these two waves have different frequencies due to Doppler effect Therefore, these two waves travel at different speeds. Doppler radar is a good example. With two moving surfaces to reflect the radio wave between them, the radio wave can be accelerated if the distance between two reflective surfaces decreases with time.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Huseyin Yilmaz proposed the form of a theory of gravitation (Yilmaz 1958, 1971) that has later been shown to present only minor conceptual change for Einstein's General Relativity. The primary effect of the change is to modify terms of second order in the gravitational potential or its derivatives. Since most of the weak field tests that have been taken as confirmation of General Relativity are of first order, the Yilmaz theory continues to pass all of these tests, but there are some interesting effects of the higher order terms that arise in the Yilmaz theory. These corrections move the metric singularity back to the location of a point particle source. This eliminates the black hole event horizon and permits the existence of intrinsic magnetic moments for stellar mass black hole candidates and supermassive AGN. It is shown here that the same second order corrections also eliminate the need for cosmological ``dark energy&quot;. Additional considerations dicussed here show that the Yilmaz theory correctly encompasses all of the major observational tests that must be satisfied by an acceptable relativistic gravity theory.</div>

<div class='title'>Accelerating Hubble Redshift</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/william_q_sumner">William Q. Sumner</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Understanding the &#8220;acceleration&#8221; of modern Hubble redshift measurements begins with Schr &#776;odinger. In 1939 he proved that all quantum wave functions coevolve with the curved spacetime of a closed Friedmann universe. While both photon wavelengths and atomic radii are proportional to the Fried- mann radius, the wavelengths of photons that an atom emits are proportional to the square of the radius. This larger shift in atomic emissions changes the current paradigm that redshift implies ex- pansion. Instead, redshift implies the contraction of a closed Friedmann universe. Hubble redshifts are observed only when old blueshifted photons are compared to current atomic emissions that have blueshifted even more. This theoretical prediction is confirmed by modern Hubble redshift measure- ments. The Pantheon redshift data set of 1048 supernovas was analyzed assuming that atoms change like Schro &#776;dinger predicted. The Hubble constant and deceleration parameter are the only variables. The fit, Ho = &#8722;72.03 &#177; 0.25 km s&#8722;1Mpc&#8722;1 and 1/2 &lt; qo &lt; 0.501, has a standard deviation 0.1516 compared to the average data error 0.1418. No modifications to general relativity or to Friedmann&#8217;s 1922 solution are necessary to explain accelerating Hubble redshifts. A nearly flat Friedmann universe accelerating in collapse is enough.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we investigate some consequences of the black hole stabilization of Schwarzschild in the presence of quintessence type of dark energy which leads the way to the black hole mass decreasing other than the Hawking radiation process. The results show that in the quintessence field, the black hole shows a second-order phase transition, implying the existence of a stable phase. However, this stabilization implies some paradoxical effects on the black hole, which gives us a new regard about black holes, precisely we obtain the negative absolute temperature and we propose a process permitting us to appreciate well the likely cause of this phenomenon. These results allow us to give a new definition of the surface gravity for the Schwarzschild black hole in the field of quintessence, which depends on the flux of dilatation produced by the quintessence type of dark energy. Afterward, we analyze the impact of dark energy on the power and the time of two black holes needed to coalesce.

<div class='title'>The Black Hole Binary Gravitons and Thermodynamics</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/miroslav_pardy">Miroslav Pardy</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The energy spectrum of graviton emitted by the black hole binary is calculated in the first part of the chapter. Then, the total quantum loss of energy, is calculated in the Schwinger theory of gravity. In the next part we determine the electromagnetic shift of energy levels of H-atom electrons by calculating an electron coupling to the black hole thermal bath. Energy shift of electrons in H-atom is determined in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. In the last section we determine the velocity of sound in the black hole atmosphere, which is here considered as the black hole photon sea. Derivation is based on the thermodynamic theory of the black hole photon gas.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Based on conservation law of energy, Poynting vector describes the power per unit area in electromagnetic wave. The time-averaged power per unit area is independent of the wavelength and the frequency of the wave. One example is FM radio signal. In photoelectric effect, the incident light wave transfers energy to the electron. Light wave of higher frequency takes longer time to transfer more energy to the electron. The total energy absorbed by the electron is proportional to the area facing the incident light. From this area, the radius of the electron can be calculated.</div>

<div class='title'>Newton's Invariant Mass Has Remained Invariant.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chan_rasjid_kah_chew">Chan Rasjid Kah Chew</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Contemporary mainstream physics has accepted special relativity to be a fully tested and verified theory. The internet has been full of references for experiments that purportedly verified special relativity. This article argues that many of these experiments purportedly verifying special relativity are irrelevant as evidence; a commonly quoted example being the Kaufmann, Bucherer and Neumann experiments. On the contrary, there is only one lone uncorroborated experiment that shows some evidence of the validity of special relativity - the 1964 experiment of William Bertozzi of the MIT; for the matter, the experiment provides only a weak evidence with 10% accuracy. If a lone experiment were sufficient as evidence in science, then the 1989 Pons & Fleischmann experiment could have won the experimenters a Nobel Prize in physics - they did not. The author proposes a simple experiment that could decide incontrovertibly between the two competing mechanics, the old Newtonian mechanics or the &#8220;newer&#8221; special relativity - by just directly measuring the velocity of electrons ejected in natural beta decay. To date, despite the simplicity of the experiment, no one has performed the experiment.</div>

<div class='title'>Dishonesty In Academia To Promote Special Relativity.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chan_rasjid_kah_chew">Chan Rasjid Kah Chew</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A central feature of special relativity is the increase of mass with velocity - mass going to infinity when a body approaches the speed limit of light. This feature is of the utmost importance as special relativity has been accepted by modern physics to have clearly proven Newtonian mechanics to be wrong fundamentally; Newton&#8217;s mechanics has mass to be an invariant property of matter. As it is expected that students would not easily accept a dismissal of Newton&#8217;s monumental work, the Principia, the physics academia tries to have a way to convince students that indeed this central feature of mass increasing with velocity could even be verified through experiments done in the usual laboratory of a university. The fact of the matter is otherwise - that even the original ex- periments by Kaufmann (1901), Bucherer (1908) that attempted to show mass increasing with velocity are flawed as the author has shown. The proposed simplified experiments are tantamount to fraud propagated on unsuspecting students who may not have the time to delve into the issues more thoroughly.</div>

<div class='title'>The Relativistic Mechanics of E=mc2 Fails</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chan_rasjid_kah_chew">Chan Rasjid Kah Chew</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The relativistic mechanics of contemporary physics does not have a defined unit of force. Its definition of force as F=d/dt(mv/&#8730;(1-v&#178;/c&#178;)) does not define a real standard unit of force. A Newtonian unit of force, e.g. the SI newton, may not be used in any of the relativistic formulas; it is a real unit of force only with Newtonian mechanics which observes Newton&#8217;s second law of motion as an axiom defining a unit of force as mass &#215; acceleration. Without a unit of force, the application of the work-energy theorem produces only a formula that evaluates only to a pure number which has no association with any real unit of energy. All values of energy from relativistic mechanics are, therefore, fictitious. The implication is grave. The well known equation: E = mc&#178; and the central identity of relativistic mechanics: E&#178; = (pc)&#178; + m&#178;c&#8308; are now invalidated. The quantum electrodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics are now highly questionable. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of CERN where protons are propelled to near the speed of light, the purported energy of the relativistic protons is 6.5TeV, but the real value is only 470MeV - the reported energy being inflated by a factor of 15,000. The Kaufmann-Bucherer-Neumann experiments were not evidence for a mass varying with speed; they showed only a contradiction between the Lorentz force law with Newton&#8217;s force law. The correct conclusion is not a failure of invariant mass of Newtonian mechanics, but evidence of failure of the Lorentz force law at relativistic speed conditions. Nature does not seem to favor any relativistic mechanics. We may have to fall back on our old Newtonian mechanics.</div>

<div class='title'>1908 Bucherer Experiment And The Lorentz Force Law</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chan_rasjid_kah_chew">chan Rasjid Kah Chew</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Bucherer experiment of 1908 was not experimental proof of a relativistic mass varying with speed, but proof that electromagnetism and the Lorentz force law fail under relativistic speed conditions. Our conclusions come from a novel re-examination of the experiment based on three different interpretations of New ton&#8217;s second law as applied to the experiment and to analyze the implications for each of: (1) force&#8733;dp/dt (2) force=relativistic_mass&#215;acceleration (3) the classical f = ma The new interpretation now shows a constant charge-mass ratio for all relativistic speed; both charge and mass would be speed invariant. New relativistic force laws had to be proposed to be consistent with the experimental findings; the Lorentz force law is now: F = q((1+v&#178;/c&#178;)&#8730;(1-v&#178;/c&#178;) E + &#8730;(1-v&#8308;/c&#8308;) (v x B) ); the Coulomb&#8217;s law is: F = (1+v&#178;/c&#178;)&#8730;(1-v&#178;/c&#178;) (1/4&#960;&#949;&#8320;)q&#8321;q&#8322;R/r&#178;; The Coulomb&#8217;s law has an additional scalar factor dependent on the relative velocity between the charges; for small speed, the form is: F = (1+&#189;v&#178;/c&#178;)(1/4&#960;&#949;&#8320;)q&#8321;q&#8322;R/r&#178;; This enables the formula for the force between parallel current-carrying conductors: F_dl = &#956;&#8320;/(2&#960;R)i&#8321;i&#8322;dl, be derived free of the concept of the magnetic field. A real possibility exists for a formulation of a revolutionary Newtonian electric theory free of magnetism and the Biot-Savart law.Also,the Bucherer experiment could have been an experimental verification of the relativistic Lorentz force law if the predicted speeds of the electrons had been verified through direct time-of-flight measurements.</div>

<div class='title'>Mass Energy Equivalence Not Experimentally Verified</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chan_rasjid_kah_chew">Chan Rasjid Kah Chew</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The notion of mass-energy equivalence and its mathematical expression through the famous equation E = mc&#178; predates Einstein when he introduced special relativity in 1905. It has to be noted that E = mc&#178; has no rigorous theoretical basis; it is only a pure hypothesis not related to any physical theory. The thesis of this paper is that there is no incontrovertible experimental verification of mass-energy equivalence. The Year_Of_Physics_2005 &#8216;Direct Test Of E = mc&#178;&#8217; published in Nature 2005 claims a verification of the equation to an accuracy of 0.00004%. The experimenters misunderstood the very nature of the experiment that they carried out. It was not a verification of E = mc&#178;, but just another experiment to deduce the mass of the neutron. To date,we have not measured the true mass of the neutron to any degree of accuracy; we only have a deduced estimate of the neutron mass based on the mass-energy equivalence of E = mc&#178; .</div>

<div class='abstract'>In a previous article it was shown that the end state for the dust metric of Oppenheimer and Snyder has most of its mass concentrated just inside the gravitational radius; it is proposed that the resulting object be considered as an idealized shell collapsar. Here the treatment is extended to include the family of interior metrics described by Choquet-Bruhat. The end state is again a shell collapsar, and its structure depends on the density pro&#133;le at the beginning of the collapse. What is lacking in most previous commentaries on the Oppenheimer- Snyder article is the recognition that Oppenheimer and Snyder matched the time coordinate at the surface, and that implies a &#133;nite upper limit for the comoving time coordinate inside the collapsar. A collapse process having all the matter going inside the gravitational radius would require comoving times which go outside that upper limit.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/moninder_singh_modgil">Moninder Singh Modgil</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The General Relativistic G\&quot;{o}del-Brahe model visualizes the universe rotating with angular velocity $2 \pi$ radians/day - around a stationary earth. The wave function of this model of universe $\psi_{Univ}$, has two chiral states - clockwise and anti clockwise. Due to instabilities in the electromagnetic fields, the wave function can tunnel between the two states. G\&quot;{o}del-Rindler model with a heigth varying acceleration gives the gravitational field of the earth. G\&quot;{o}del-Obukhov model with a sinusoidally varying scale factor gives the yearly north-south motion of the sun. G\&quot;{o}del-Randall-Sundram model with an angular velocity varying with height, gives the yearly rotation of sun with respect to the back ground of the fixed stars. Confinement of light rays due to rotation in the G\&quot;{o}del universe, coupled with an appropriate mapping, generates the illusion of sphericity over a flat earth - with half of earth lit by sun light and the other half in darkness. Finally a metric combining all these properties is given. Discussion of further work is given, namely - (1) Origin of earth's magnetic field due to a charged G\&quot;{o}del universe - with a relation to the Van Allen radiation belt, (2) Geomagnetic reversals due to reversals of cosmological rotation, (3) Caismir energy in the charged G\&quot;{o}del type universe and the energy density required for the G\&quot;{o}del-Brahe model and (4) Behaviour of Causality in G\&quot;{o}del universe and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox.</div>

<div class='title'>Six Different Natario Warp Drive Spacetime Metric Equations.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$.Alcubierre used the so-called $3+1$ original Arnowitt-Dresner-Misner($ADM$) formalism using the approach of Misner-Thorne-Wheeler to develop his warp drive theory.As a matter of fact the first equation in his warp drive paper is derived precisely from the original $3+1$ $ADM$ formalism and we have strong reasons to believe that Natario which followed the Alcubierre steps also used the original $3+1$ $ADM$ formalism to develop the Natario warp drive spacetime.Several years ago some works appeared in the scientific literature advocating two new parallel $3+1$ $ADM$ formalisms.While the original $ADM$ formalism uses mixed contravariant and covariant scripts one of the new parallel formalisms uses only contravariant scripts while the other uses only covariant scripts.Since the Natario vector is the generator of the Natario warp drive spacetime metric in this work we expand the original Natario vector including the coordinate time as a new Canonical Basis for the Hodge star generating an expanded Natario vector and we present $6$ equations for the Natario warp drive spacetime $3$ of them with constant velocities one for the original $ADM$ formalism and $2$ other for the parallel formalisms. We also present the corresponding $3$ extended versions of the Natario warp drive spacetime metric which encompasses accelerations and variable velocities both in the original and parallel $ADM$ formalisms.</div>

Complex and quaternion phase are combined in the wavefunction to generate new multiplectic structures.

<div class='title'>The Chronology Protection Conjecture and the Formation of the Kerr Black Hole Through Gravitational Collapse</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/moninder_singh_modgil">Moninder Singh Modgil</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Exterior of the Kerr black hole is considered as the likely spacetime geometry around a black hole formed by gravitational collapse. However the Kerr black hole has chronology violating Closed Time-like Curves (CTCs), near the ring singularity in interior. Hawking has considered formation of CTCs using a scalar field and shown that back reaction of nature - divergence of energy-momentum tensor - would prevent formation of CTCs. The question being raised here is whether the physics behind Hawking's concept of &quot;chronology protection&quot;, will actually prevent formation of the Kerr black hole - through gravitational collapse. On the other hand, if the Kerr black hole indeed gets formed by gravitational collapse, then one has a counter example to Chronology Protection Conjecture. Chronology protection thus imposes the constraint that formation of a rotating black hole through gravitational collapse should be such that the interior metric of the black hole does not match that of the Kerr black hole, or any other black hole with CTCs. It is possible that the quantum gravity effects rule out formation of CTCs during gravitational collapse - as they are expected to remove singularities. There may however be classical solutions to the problem. Angular momentum orginating from the rotation and the formation of CTCs are intimately related - through the off diagonal term $g_{t \phi}$ i.e., the coefficient of the $dtd\phi$ term (corresponding to the temporal coordinate $t$ and the longitudinal angular coordinate $\phi$) - of the metric tensor. A possible solution is that during the gravitational collapse, all the angular momentum of the star, is radiated away by gravitational waves - leaving behind as residual, the Schwarzschild black hole.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Based on Fizeau's experiment, the single cogwheel is replaced with two rotating disks to measure the one-way speed of light. A single slit is cut out in the radial direction on each disk for the light to pass through the disk. With both disks rotating at the same angular speed, the light can pass through both disks only if the second slit is in a different radial direction from the first slit. The light takes time to travel from the first disk to the second disk.

<div class='abstract'>The observational evidence in Astrophysics clearly shows that if the light bending rule of General Relativity were actually valid, then the following would be the consequences: The star-abundant skies would be filled with images of Einstein rings. At high impact parameters far above the plasma rim of the stars, the astrophysical observations of deep space would be totally denied to all modern Astronomy. Deep space images of the skies due to gravitational lensing effects, would be completely blurred to all modern astronomy. The sought after Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) or simply put, the modification of Newton's law and/or General Relativity, in the attempt to satisfactorily explain the prevailing observations pertaining to the subject matters of gravitational lensing and the so-called dark matter would be totally unnecessary. These findings are clearly supported by the observational evidence.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The golden ratio Phi is very important in the modified cosmological model (MCM). In previous work, we have inserted it artificially rather than showing where it comes from. Where the real numbers are extended to the complex numbers for routine physical applications, we extend the complex numbers to the hypercomplex numbers and show that Phi is inherent to the transfinite structure. We formalize the transfinite concept of continuation beyond infinity. We improve upon previous motivations for deriving general relativity and the fine structure constant in the MCM, and we propose an origin for the Yang-Mills mass gap.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Time in a reference frame can be represented by a rotating ring with constant angular velocity. The rotational motion of this ring is not affected by any acceleration parallel to its axis of rotation. The rotation period remains constant as the ring accelerates along the axis of rotation. The rotation period in the rest frame of the ring is always constant. Therefore, the rotation period is independent of reference frame. The rotation period represents the elapsed time in a reference frame. As a result, the elapsed time is also independent of reference frame. Consequently, time is independent of reference frame.</div>

<div class='title'>N &#8722; Dimensional Ads Related Spacetime and Its Transformation</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/thomas_gunther">Thomas G&#252;nther</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recently, anti-de Sitter spaces are used in promising theories of quantum gravity like the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence. The latter provides an approach to string theorie, which includes more than four dimensions. Unfortunately, the anti-de Sitter model contains no mass and is not able to describe our universe adequately. Nevertheless, the rising interest in higherdimensional theories motivates to take a deeper look at the n-dimensional AdS Spacetime. In this paper, a solution of Einstein's field equations is constructed from a modified anti-de Sitter metric in n dimensions. The idea is based on the connection between Schwarzschild- and McVittie metric: McVittie's model, which interpolates between a Schwarzschild Black Hole and an expanding global Friedmann&#8211;Lema&#238;tre&#8211;Robertson&#8211;Walker spacetime, can be constructed by a simple coordinate replacement in Schwarzschild's isotropic intervall, where radial coordinate and it's differential is multiplied by a time dependent scale factor a(t). In a previous work I showed, that an exact solution of Einstein's equations can analogously be generated from a static transformation of de Sitter's metric. The present article is concerned with the application of this method on an AdS (Anti de Sitter) related spacetime in n dimensions. It is shown that the resulting isotropic intervall is a solution of the n-dimensional Einstein equations. Further, it is transformed into a spherical symmetric but anisotropic form, analogously to the transformtion found by Kaloper, Kleban and Martin for McVittie's metric.</div>

<div class='title'>Dark Matter and the Energy-Momentum of the Gravitational Field</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/gary_nash">Gary Nash</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The $\Lambda $ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model assumes general relativity is correct. However, the Einstein equation does not contain a symmetric tensor which describes the energy-momentum of the gravitational field itself. Recently, a modified equation of general relativity was developed which contains the missing tensor and completes the Einstein equation. An exact static solution was obtained from the modified Einstein equation in a spheroidal metric describing the gravitational field outside of its source, which does not contain dark matter. The flat rotation curves for a class of galaxies were calculated and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation followed directly from the gravitational energy-momentum tensor. The Newtonian rotation curves for galaxies with no flat orbital curves, and those with rising rotation curves for large radii were described as examples of the flexibility of the orbital rotation curve equation.</div>

<div class='title'>Gravity Without Newton&#8217;s Gravitational Constant and no Knowledge of Mass Size</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we show that the Schwarzschild radius can be extracted easily from any gravitationally-linked phenomena without having knowledge of Newton's gravitational constant or the mass size of the gravitational object. Further, the Schwarzschild radius can be used to predict any gravity phenomena accurately, again without knowledge of Newton's gravitational constant and also without knowledge of the size of the mass, although this may seem surprising at first. Hidden within the Schwarzschild radius are the mass of the gravitational object, the Planck mass, and the Planck length, which we will assert contain the secret essence related to gravity, in addition to the speed of light, (the speed of gravity). This seems to indicate that gravity is quantized, even at the cosmological scale, and this quantization is directly linked to the Planck units. This also supports our view that Newton's gravitational constant is a universal composite constant of the form G=l_p^2c^3/hbar, rather than relying on the Planck units as a function of G. This does not mean that Newton's gravitational constant is not a universal constant, but rather that it is a composite universal constant, which depends on the Planck length, the speed of light, and the Planck constant. This is, to our knowledge, the first paper that shows how a long series of major gravity predictions and measurements can be completed without any knowledge of the mass size of the object, or Newton's gravitational constant. As a minimum, we think it provides an interesting new angle for evaluating existing theories of gravitation, and it may even provide a hint on how to combine quantum gravity with Newton and Einstein gravity.</div>

<div class='title'>The Time Scale of Gravitational Collapse</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/trevor_w_marshall">Trevor W. Marshall</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In a previous article it was shown that the end state for the dust metric of Oppenheimer and Snyder has most of its mass concentrated just inside the gravitational radius; it is proposed that the resulting object be considered as an idealized \emph{shell collapsar}. Here the treatment is extended to include the family of interior metrics described by Weinberg, and involving the curvature parameter of a Friedmann metric. The end state is again a shell collapsar, with a shell which becomes more concentrated as the curvature parameter increases, which shows that the details of the shell structure are dependent on the initial density profile at the beginning of the collapse. What is lacking in most previous commentaries on the Oppenheimer-Snyder article is the recognition that their matching of the time coordinate at the surface implies a finite upper limit for the comoving time coordinate. A collapse process having all the matter going inside the gravitational radius would require comoving times which go outside that limit.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This study presents a unique set of solutions, using empirically determined physical quantities, in achieving a novel dimensionless constant &#945;(1/Roo )/PL from the ratio of the inverse of the Rydberg constant to the Planck length. It is henceforth shown that the Lorentz Scalar coming into play, which we dub the Parana constant, necessitates us to interpret the Gravitational constant G as being neither universal nor Lorentz Invariant. Just the same, the elementary charge in the MKS system should not by itself be considered as Lorentz Invariant, but the term e^2 / &#949;o , including its powers, ought to be. That being the case, the &#8220;Rydberg constant&#8221; must not, according to the present undertaking, be deemed a ubiquitous magnitude either, but the ratio of its reciprocal to Planck length would, in effect, be. The Parana constant is furthermore shown to exhibit meaningfulness as the proportion of the Planck mass to the electron rest mass. Throughout our derivations, we take the oppurtunity to reveal interesting features and deliberate over them.</div>

<div class='title'>A New 'more Natural' Toe Model with Covariant Emergent Gravity as a Solution to the Dark Sector</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/j_gregory_moxness">J Gregory Moxness</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Arguments have been raised against several of the central ideas in theoretical physics, such as M-Theory's (MT's) inability to provide for the falsification necessary to avoid relegating it to the scientific dustbin of an anthropic principle based rationalization, such as the Multiverse. Along similar lines, ideas of a uniquely falsifiable inflation era after the Big Bang (BB) have also lost some of their traction. Recent major experimental results too have sent shock waves, such as the confirmation of the low Higgs mass constraining notions of super symmetry, and the Planck satellite's detail mapping of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fixing the Hubble parameter at odds with other more traditional methods. Even the null results of major experimental apparatus are causing consternation, as in the search for particle based Dark Matter (DM). Thankfully, all this seems to be opening the door for a more serious investigation into alternative theories that attempt to answer the big questions related to the causal relationships between the Standard Model (SM), General Relativity (GR), and 95\% of the known Universe, namely cosmology's dark sector (Dark Energy (DE) and DM). This paper attempts to connect the dots between some of these alternative ideas as they relate to MOdified Newtonian Gravity (MOND), covariant emergent gravity (CEG), and the fundamental parameters used to fix Natural or Planck units-of-measure. The result is intended to point the way toward a fresh discussion in the directions available for unification of GR with SM while resolving the now more open problems in theoretical physics today.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Ongoing proliferation of interpretations of the formalism of quantum mechanics over the course of nearly a century originates in historical choices of wavefunction, and in particular with assignment of geometric and topological attributes to unintuitive internal intrinsic properties of point particle quarks and leptons. Significant simplification and intuitive appeal arise if one extends Dirac&#8217;s two-component spinors to the full eight-component Pauli algebra of 3D space, providing a geometric representation of wavefunctions and their interactions that is comparatively easily visualized. We outline how the resulting quantized impedance network of geometric wavefunction interactions yields a naturally finite, confined, and gauge invariant model of both the unstable particle spectrum and quantum gravity that is consistent with and clarifies interpretation of both special relativity and the equivalence principle.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Since the experimental event of abnormal speeds within galaxies was discovered; the so-called dark matter is incessantly sought. But all the experiments still do not find such a ghost. Its justification is supported, in the apparent, simplest explanation: the existence of a matter additional to the baryonic matter within the galaxies. But there is another possible explanation more natural and just as simple: A modification of the gravity due to the occurrence of effects of quantum gravity produced by the repulsive acceleration of the vacuum. A repulsion of the vacuum would produce, as we demonstrated with the experiments with magnets of equal polarity, a pressure towards the center of mass and, therefore, a fictitious increase in mass. In this short article; we calculate the average speed of rotation within the newly discovered ultradiffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2. This calculation shows that the equation, type MOND, agrees perfectly with the estimated velocities. Therefore, some voices that too quickly have announced that this galaxy (almost without dark matter or anything of it) does not agree with the theories of modified gravitation (we refer to the quantum gravitation that would quantize the equations of Einstein's gravitation, or GR); they are simply avoiding the real explanation: effects of quantum gravity produced by the vacuum (very large masses of galaxies).</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Pythagorean Theorem, combined with the analytic geometry of a right circular cone, has been used by H. Minkowski and subsequent investigators to establish the 4-dimensional spacetime continuum associated with A. Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. Although the mathematics appears sound, the incorporation of a hyper-cone into the analytic geometry of a right triangle in Euclidean 3-space is in conflict with the rules of pure mathematics. A metric space of n dimensions is necessarily defined in terms of n independent coordinates, one for each dimension. Any coordinate that is a combination of the others for a given space is not independent so cannot be an independent dimension. Minkowski-Einstein spacetime contains a dimensional coordinate, via the speed of light, that is not independent. Consequently, Minkowski-Einstein spacetime does not exist.</div>

<div class='title'>Time as Motion Phenomenon Physics Laws do not Apply to Inertial Systems</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/michael_tzoumpas">Michael Tzoumpas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In the unified theory of dynamic space the quantum time is identical to the elementary motion, traveled by electrically opposite elementary units (in short units) in the interval (click-shift) of the quantum dipole length at the speed of light. The quantum time in the units region is the Natural time, that replaced the conventional time, i.e. the second. Nature understands time, as a crowd of moving units, as a length traveled with click-shifts and as a volume occupied by the units. Therefore, time is reflected in the structures of space by the number of their units. However, motion is a form of space deformation, created by force that is reduced from the dynamic space as motion force, which is accumulated on the spherical zone of the particle, due to the difference of cohesive pressure in front of and behind it. This accumulation is made by force talantonion (oscillator) per quantum time in the formations region as quantum force, causing harmonic change to the difference of cohesive pressure in proximal space of the particle as a motion wave (wave-like form), the so-called de Broglie's wave-particle. The Physical meaning of Planck's constant is interpreted as the product of three Nature's entities, namely the force talantonion (which is the foundation of motion), the quantum dipole length and the quantum time in the formations region. The &quot;relative&quot; mass has now been proved and the proof is not based on the second postulate of relativity. So, the particle mass does not in fact increase, when it moves, but only the final force (of gravity and motion), which causes the new dynamics of particle motion, increases. This new dynamics appears as a tension of space, which is maintained in a different way for each uniform motion, resulting the change of the Physics Laws in different inertial systems.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Einstein's general relativistic field equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that lacks an easy way to obtain exact solutions. The most famous examples are Schwarzschild and Kerr's black hole solutions. The Kerr metric has astrophysical meaning because most of cosmic celestial bodies are rotating. The Kerr metric is even more difficult to derive than the Schwarzschild metric specifically due to off-diagonal term of metric tensor. In this paper, a derivation of Kerr metric was obtained by ellipsoid coordinate transformation, which causes elimination a large amount of tedious derivation. This derivation is not only physics enlightening, but also further deducing some characteristics of the rotating black hole.</div>

<div class='title'>The Fundamentality of Gravity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_j_benish">Richard J Benish</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>After the physicality of existence, gravity's role in the Universe is the most fundamental thing. This role has various manifestations which, it is argued, have been largely misinterpreted by modern physics. An alternative conception of gravity---one that agrees with firmly established empirical evidence---is most compactly characterized by its definition of Newton's constant in terms of other fundamental constants. This expression and supporting arguments largely fulfill the long-standing goal of unifying gravity with the other forces. Phenomena spanning atomic nuclei to the large-scale cosmos and the basic physical elements, mass, space, and time, are thereby seen as comprising an interdependent (unified) whole. Meanwhile, a virtual industry of fanciful, far-from-fundamental mathematical distractions clog up the literature of what is still called fundamental physics. By contrast with this dubious activity---most importantly---the new conception is empirically testable. The test would involve probing gravity where it has not yet been probed: inside (through the center) of every body of matter.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Time in an inertial reference frame can be obtained from the definition of velocity in that inertial reference frame. Velocity depends on coordinate and time. Therefore, coordinate transformation and velocity transformation between inertial reference frames can lead to time transformation. Based on this approach, the time transformation between two arbitrary inertial reference frames in one dimensional space is derived. The result shows that the elapsed time is identical in all inertial reference frames.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This article presents a new theory or at least interpretation of relativity whereby relativistic effects emerge as a result of rationing of Newtonian time into spatial and intrinsic motions. Unlike special theory of relativity, this theory does not need to postulate that speed of light (c) is constant for all reference frames. The constancy of speed of light emerges from more basic principles.This theory postulates that :&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Postulate 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The speed of spatial motion of a particle is always c.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Postulate 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Spatial motion and intrinsic motion continuously, linearly, and symmetrically rub into each other.&lt;br/&gt; Postulate 1 seems reasonable because the Dirac model of electron (i.e. its &lt;strong&gt;zitterbewegung&lt;/strong&gt; interpretation) indicates that the speed in the intrinsic degrees of freedom of an electron is always c. If the spatial speed was anything other than c then transitioning between spatial and intrinsic motions would have entailed repeated cycles of high accelerations and deccelerations. Postulate 2 is also reasonable because it is the simplest and most symmetric way for the spatial and intrinsic time-shares to co-evolve in time. An observer's physical measure of time is entirely encoded by its intrinsic motions. This is the relativistic time. The time spent in spatial motion does not cause any change of the particle's internal configuration, and therefore does not contribute to its measurable time.&lt;br/&gt; If an observer races against a photon, the photon will always lead ahead with a relative speed of c because light advances with respect to the observer only for the duration of the observer's intrinsic motion, i.e. for the full duration of its measurable time. During spatial motion, the observer moves at the same speed as the photon. Consequently the observed relative speed of light - i.e. the spatial advance of light divided by the measurable time is always c. Thus in the limited sense of racing a photon, constancy of its measured speed is a deduced result here. The broader question of relative velocity of an observer with respect to a photon or a light wave-front is clarified in section 5</div>

<div class='abstract'>The unified theory of dynamic space has been conceived and written by Professor Physicist Naoum Gosdas, inspired from the principle of antithesis (opposition), because of which all natural phenomena are created. These phenomena are derived from the unique absolute dynamic space. So, the explanation of Michelson-Morley experiment is based on the above theory, namely on both actual and the known apparent reduction of light speed, without the second postulate of relativity. The actual reduction of light speed happens only when the light is transmitted on moving material systems, on which the cohesive pressure of the proximal space is reduced.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A moving object in one inertial reference frame always moves at a different speed in another inertial reference frame. To determine this different speed, a temporary acceleration is applied to a duplicate of the first inertial reference frame in order to match the second inertial reference frame. The velocity transformation between two inertial reference frames is precisely derived based on the applied acceleration. The result shows that velocity transformation depends exclusively on the relative motion between inertial reference frames. Velocity transformation is independent of the speed of light.</div>

<div class='title'>The General Relevance of the Modified Cosmological Model</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jonathan_w_tooker">Jonathan W. Tooker</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The modified cosmological model (MCM) has been an active research program since 2009 and here we summarize the highlights while providing background and insights as they demonstrate mathematical merit. The main ``modification'' that underpins this work is to consider the principle of greatest action, not least, but cosmological energy functions do not appear. To accommodate infinite action, we develop a transfinite analytical framework $^\star\mathbb{C}$. In the first chapter, we define the MCM system as the union of two Kaluza--Klein theories disconnected by a topological obstruction. We identify a detail overlooked by Feynman in his ``many double slits'' thought experiment with which we directly motivate the principle of maximum action. Chapter two is mostly a review of fundamental concepts including twistors and quaternions. Much attention in chapter three is given to what are perceived as criticisms of the MCM mechanism for the unification of the theories of gravitation and quanta, and we closely examine the derivation of Einstein's equation from unrelated MCM concepts. The main technical result in chapter three is to demonstrate that dark energy and expanding space are inherent to the MCM metric and we examine the role of the advanced electromagnetic potential in ``hyperspacetime.'' Chapter four is a tour de force starting with a review of the foundations of the MCM. We extend Dirac's bra-ket to an MCM inner product for $^\star\mathbb{C}$. We continue with a study of conformal infinity and the transfinite extension into the region ``beyond conformal infinity.'' The double slit experiment gives an example of the empirical/philosophical utilities of the MCM principles and we examine their extension into the realm of numerical analysis before deriving the main result: a new formulation for the mass-energy budget of the universe that agrees perfectly with $\Lambda$CDM.</div>

<div class='abstract'>McVittie's model, which interpolates between a Schwarzschild Black Hole and an expanding global (FLRW) spacetime, can be constructed by a simple coordinate replacement in Schwarzschild's isotropic intervall. Analogously, one gets a similarly generated exact solution of Einstein's equations based on a static transformation of de Sitter's metric. The present article is concerned with the application of this method on the AdS (Anti de Sitter) spacetime. Multiplying the radial coordinate and it's differential by a function a(t) gives the basic line element. Einstein's equations for the modified interval reduce to a system of two differential equations, which are solved in the article. The resulting solution is classified depending on the value of the cosmological constant. Several promising theories like String theorie and AdS/CFT correspondence include spacetimes with higher dimensions. Thereby motivated, the previous results of this article are generalized to D dimensions in the last section.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/evgeny_a_novikov">Evgeny A Novikov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Evolution of our universe with continuous production of matter by the vacuum, is described. The analysis is based on the quantum modification of the general relativity (Qmoger), supported by the cosmic data without fitting. Various types of matter are selected by the vacuum in accordance with stability of the developing universe. All laws of nature seems to be emergent and approximate, including the conservation of energy. The (3+1)-dimensional space-time and gravity were selected first. Than came quantum condensate of entangled gravitons (dark matter). Photons and other ordinary matter were selected much later during formation of galaxies, when the background condensate becomes gravitationally unstable. The effect of radiation on the global dynamics is described in terms of conservation of the enthalpy density. Mass of neutrino, as the first massive fermionic particle created from the background condensate, is estimated, in accord with experimental bound. The electric dipole moment of neutrino is also estimated. The oscillations of neutrinos are explained in terms of interaction with background condensate. The phenomena of quantum entanglement of ordinary matter was, apparently, inherited from the background condensate. The phenomena of subjective experiences are also explained in terms of interaction of the action potentials of neurons with the background dipolar condensate, which opens a new window into the dark sector of matter. The Qmoger theory goes beyond the Standard Model and the Quantum Field Theory and can be combined with their achievements. Key words: quantum modification of general relativity, emergence of the laws of nature, isenthalpic universe, quantum condensate of gravitons, oscillating neutrinos, subjective experiences and dark sector of matter.</div>

<div class='title'>An Extended Version of the Natario Warp Drive Equation Based in the Original $3+1$ $adm$ Formalism Which Encompasses Accelerations and Variable Velocities</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However the major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy density able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!!. With the correct form of the shape function the Natario warp drive can overcome this obstacle at least in theory.Other drawbacks that affects the warp drive geometry are the collisions with hazardous interstellar matter that will unavoidably occurs when a ship travels at superluminal speeds and the problem of the Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime).The geometrical features of the Natario warp drive are the required ones to overcome these obstacles also at least in theory.However both the Alcubierre or Natario warp drive spacetimes always have a constant speed in the internal structure of their equations which means to say that these warp drives always travel with a constant speed.But a real warp drive must accelerate from zero to a superluminal speed of about $200$ times faster than light in the beginning of an interstellar journey and de-accelerate again to zero in the end of the journey.In this work we expand the Natario vector introducing the coordinate time as a new Canonical Basis for the Hodge star and we introduce an extended Natario warp drive equation which encompasses accelerations.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A standing wave consists of two identical waves moving in opposite direction. In a moving reference frame, this standing wave becomes a traveling wave. Based on the principle of superposition, the wavelengths of these two opposing waves are shown to be identical in any inertial reference frame. According to Doppler Effect, a moving wave detector will detect two different frequencies on these two waves. Consequently, the wave detector will detect different speeds from both waves due to the same wavelength but different frequencies. The calculation of the speed of the microwave in the standing wave is demonstrated with the typical household microwave oven which emits microwave of frequency range around 2.45 GHz and wavelength range around 12.2 cm.</div>

<div class='title'>Emergence of the Laws of Nature in the Developing Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/evgeny_a_novikov">Evgeny A Novikov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Evolution of our universe with continuous production of matter by the vacuum, is described. The analysis is based on the quantum modification of the general relativity (Qmoger), supported by the cosmic data without fitting. Various types of matter are selected by the vacuum in accordance with stability of the developing universe. All laws of nature are emergent and approximate, including the conservation of energy. The (3+1)-dimensional space-time and gravity were selected first. Than came quantum condensate of gravitons (dark matter). Photons and other ordinary matter were selected much later during formation of galaxies, when the background condensate becomes gravitationally unstable. The effect of radiation on the global dynamics is described in terms of conservation of the enthalpy density. Mass and electric dipole moment of neutrino (as the first massive fermionic particle) are estimated. The oscillations of neutrinos are explained in terms of interaction with background condensate. The phenomena of subjective experiences are also explained in terms of interaction of the action potentials of neurons with the background dipolar condensate.</div>

<div class='title'>A Motion Paradox from Einstein&#8217;s Relativity of Simultaneity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We are describing a new and potentially important paradox related to Einstein&#8217;s theories of special relativity and relativity of simultaneity.1 We fully agree on all of the mathematical derivations in Ein- stein&#8217;s special relativity theory and his result of relativity of simultaneity when using Einstein-Poincar &#769;e synchronized clocks. The paradox introduced shows that Einstein&#8217;s special relativity theory leads to a motion paradox, where a train moving relative to the ground (and the ground moving relative to the train) must stand still and be moving at the same time. We will see that one reference frame will claim that the train is moving and that the other reference frame must claim that the train is standing still in the time window &#8220;between&#8221; two distant events. This goes against common sense and logic. However, looking back at the history of relativity theory, even time dilation was going against common sense and a series of academics attempted to refute it.2 Still, based on this new paradox we have to ask ourselves if the world really can be that bizarre, or if Einstein&#8217;s special relativity could be incomplete in some way? We are not going to give an answer to the second question in this paper, but we will simply present the new paradox.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The operational and canonical definitions of an energy-momentum tensor (EMT) are considered as well as the tensor and nontensor conservation laws. It is shown that the canonical EMT contradicts the experiments and the operational definition, the Belinfante-Rosenfeld procedure worsens the situation, and the nontensor &#8220;conservation laws&#8221; are meaningless. A definition of the 4-momentum of a system demands a translator since integration of vectors is meaningless. The mass of a fluid sphere is calculated. It is shown that, according to the standard energy-momentum pseudotensor, the mass-energy of a gravitational field is positive. This contradicts the idea of a negative gravitational energy and discredits the pseudotensor. And what is more, integral 4-pseudovectors are meaningless in general since reference frames for their components are not determined even for coordinates which areMinkowskian at infinity</div>

<div class='title'>On the Variation of Vacuum Permittivity in General Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/william_q_sumner">William Q Sumner</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Vacuum permittivity is the scalar in Maxwell&#8217;s equations that determines the speed of light and the strength of electrical fields. In 1907 Albert Einstein found that vacuum permittivity changes with gravity. M&#248;ller, Landau & Lifshitz, and Sumner found that it changes with spacetime curvature. The wavelengths of both photons and atomic emissions decrease with vacuum permittivity but the photons emitted from atoms decrease more than photons themselves do. This changes the interpretation of gravitational redshift to one where blueshifted photons are compared to greater blueshifted atomic emissions. For Schwarzschild geometry, redshifts can be calculated most accurately using the metric. The equation derived using time dilation and the one derived here are identical. Their weak field approximation is the same as the redshift derivation using special relativity with Doppler shift. For Friedmann geometry, redshifts calculated by comparing blueshifted atomic emissions to those of photons flips the meaning of Hubble redshift. The universe is accelerating in collapse, a result confirmed by supernova redshift observations. The equations and logic used for Friedmann and Schwarzschild redshifts are identical. Only their vacuum permittivities are different.</div>

<div class='title'>The Incompatibility of the Planck Acceleration and Modern Physics? And a New Acceleration Limit for Anything with Mass after Acceleration</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Planck second is likely the shortest relevant time interval. If the Planck acceleration lasts for one Planck second, one will reach the speed of light. Yet, according to Einstein, no particle with rest-mass can travel at the speed of light as this would require an infinite amount of energy. Modern physics is incompatible with the Planck acceleration in many ways. However in atomism we see that the Planck acceleration happens for the building blocks of the Planck mass and that the Planck mass is dissolved into energy within one Planck second. Further, the Planck mass stands absolutely still as observed from any reference frame. Atomism is fully consistent with the Planck acceleration. The relativistic Planck acceleration is unique among accelerations because it can only happen from absolute rest; it is therefore the same as the Planck acceleration. In other words, atomism predicts breaks in Lorentz invariance at the Planck scale, something several quantum gravity theories address as well. Atomism seems to solve a series of challenges in modern physics and this paper is one of a series in pointing this out.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The key to the stars and the basis for big bang cosmology is thermal emission, not the kinetic theory of gases or Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, although the latter employs thermal emission in the form given by Kirchhoff and Planck. Kirchhoff's Law of Thermal Emission is fundamental to astronomy and much of physics, including quantum mechanics. Via Kirchhoff's Law of Thermal Emission, Max Planck introduced the quantum of action in developing his equation for blackbody spectra. From Kirchhoff's Law Planck's equation acquired universality and Planck's mystical absolute units. Without Kirchhoff's Law and universality of Planck's equation, astronomy and cosmology completely collapse. Kirchhoff's Law of Thermal Emission is certainly false, as the clinical existence of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) proves. Consequently Planck's equation is not universal, Planck's absolute units have no special character, and astronomy and cosmology lose their foundations entirely.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/e_p_j_de_haas">E.P.J. de Haas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In GNSS, the improvement of atomic clocks will lead to Phi/c^2 in relativistic gravitational redshift three to four decades from today. Research towards a relativistic positioning system capable of handling this expected accuracy is all based upon the Schwarzschild metric as a replacement of todays GNSS Euclidian-Newtonian metric. The method employed in this paper to determining frequency shifts between atomic clocks is an intermediate Minkowski-EEP approach. This approach is based on relating two atomic clocks to one another through a background ensemble of frequency gauged clocks, a grid. The crucial grid of this paper, the Free Fall Grid or FFG, can be related to the Ehlers-Pirani-Schild P-CP Weyl space formalism, when applied to a central mass. The FFG second order in Phi/c^2 redshifts are derived for static to static, static to satellite and satellite to satellite atomic oscillators and then compared to GR-Schwarzschild and PPN (Parametrized Post Newtonian) results.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We lay down the fundamental hypothesis that any electromagnetic radiation transforms progressively, evolving towards and finally reaching after an appropriate distance the value of the cosmic microwave background radiation wavelength at 1,873 mm or the frequency of 160,2 GHz. This way we explain the cosmic redshift Z of far away Galaxies using only Maxwell&#8217;s equations and the energy quantum principle for photons. This hypothesis is also true for wavelength longer or for frequency less than that of the cosmic microwave bacground. Hubble&#8217;s law sprouts out naturally as the consequence of this transformation. According to this hypothesis we compute the Hubble constant using Pioneer satellite data and doing so deciphering the enigma of its anomalous behaviour. We speculate about a numerical composition of the Hubble constant and introduce the Hubble surface. This hypothesis helps to solve some cases that are still enigmatic for the standard cosmology. We discuss about the maximal observation distance of cosmological phenomena. We give an answer to the anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer satellite and we show that it is a universal constant common to any satellite.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The formation of Primordial Black Holes is a robust prediction of several gravitational theories. Whereas the creation of PBHs was very active in the remote past, such process seem to be very negligible at the present epoch. In this work, we estimate the effects from the radiation surrounding PBHs due to the absorption term in the equations that describe how their masses depend on time. The Hawking radiation contributes with mass loss and the absorption term contributes with gain, but a interesting competition between these terms is analysed. These effects are included in the equations describing PBHs and its mass density as the universe evolves in time and the model is able to describes the evolution of the numerical density of PBHs and the mass evolution and comparisons with cosmological constraints set upper limits in their abundances. We evaluate the effect of this accretion onto PBHs and we get some corrections for the initial masses that indicates some deviations from de- fault values for the time scale for evaporation. The scale time of the PBHs in the early universe is modified due to the energy accretion and we can estimate how these contributions may alter the standard model of PBHs.</div>

<div class='title'>Holy Cosmic Condensate of Ultralight Gravitons with Electric Dipole Moment</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/evgeny_a_novikov">Evgeny A Novikov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Quantum modification of general relativity (Qmoger) is supported by cosmic data (without fitting). Qmoger equations consist of Einstein equations with two additional terms responsible for production/absorption of matter. In Qmoger cosmology there was no Big Bang and matter is continuously producing by the Vacuum. Particularly, production of the ultralight gravitons with possible tiny electric dipole moment was started about 284 billion years ago. Quantum effects dominate interaction of these particles and they form the quantum condensate. Under influence of gravitation, the condensate is forming galaxies and producing ordinary matter, including photons. As one important result of this activity, it recently created us, the people, and continues to support us. Particularly, our subjective experiences (qualia) are a result of an interaction between the background condensate and the neural system of the brain. The action potentials of neural system create traps and coherent dynamic patterns in the dipolar condensate. So, qualia are graviton-based, which can open new directions of research in biology and medicine. At the same time, a specialized study of qualia can open a new window into the dark sector of matter. The Qmoger theory explains why most of the ordinary particles are fermions, predicts the mass of neutrino (in accord with the experimental bound) and explained their oscillations (between three flavors) in terms of interaction with the background condensate. The achievements of the Standard Model and the Quantum Field Theory can be combined with the Qmoger theory. Key words: cosmology with continuous production of energy, ultralight gravitons with tiny electric dipole moment, biophysics, qualia.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ernst_schmutzer">Ernst Schmutzer</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper the behaviour of a matter torus under the influence of the expanding cosmos model (according to our theory PUFT) is investigated. This task can numerically be treated for the full life time of the cosmos model (from the Urstart to the Finish). As we know from our literature cited, the graphic course of the cosmological scalaric field after the Urstart exhibits an increase , followed by a return down to the Finish. This curious behaviour of the cosmological scalaric field leads to the suspicion that the shape of the torus during the life time of the cosmos may be: sphere at the Urstart, transformation of the sphere to a ring with decreasing thickness, return to a sphere at the Finish. It seems that such a theoretically predicted physical effect could perhaps exist in Nature. The torus was chosen as a test object, since the numerical calculations can be done without approximation procedures. We took this rather simple example to show this cosmological effect for further applications in astrophysics.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The time shown by a moving clock depends on its history. The Lorentz transform does not distinguish between the history of an accelerated clock and a constant velocity clock. The history of the clock can be assimilated by integrating the first derivative of the Thomas precession from the time t=0. A definite integral is required because the unknown trajectory of the clock in the distant past affects its displayed time. The coordinates are spinning in the second frame of reference during the integration, but in the definite integral from time t=0 to time t the spin accumulates to a specific angle. The integral is equivalent to a Lorentz transform followed by a space rotation. A space rotation does not affect the invariant quantity r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The history of a jerked clock is different than that of an accelerated clock. The solution in that order is equivalent to a Lorentz transform followed by two consecutive space rotations in different directions. Similarly, there are three rotations in the &lt;b&gt;&#228;&lt;/b&gt; solution.</div>

<div class='title'>Special Relativity in Complex Space-Time. Part 2. Basic Problems of Electrodynamics.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jozef_radomanski">Jozef Radomanski</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This article discusses an electric field in complex space-time. Using an orthogonal paravector transformation that preserves the invariance of the wave equation and does not belong to the Lorentz group, the Gaussian equation has been transformed to obtain the relationships corresponding to the Maxwell equations. These equations are analysed for compliance with classic electrodynamics. Although, the Lorenz gauge condition has been abandoned and two of the modified Maxwell's equations are different from the classical ones, the obtained results are not inconsistent with the experience because they preserve the classical laws of the theory of electricity and magnetism contained therein. In conjunction with the previous papers our purpose is to show that space-time of high velocity has a complex structure that differently orders the laws of classical physics but does not change them.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Postulate of General covariance, a last choice that Einstein introduced in his General relativity theory of gravitation, endows the theory with an excessive generality that needs to be restrained. Otherwise it is easy to check that, beyond the first order of approximation, several space-time models, all of them derived from the original Schwarzschild's initial solution of Einstein's field equations corresponding to a static spherical source, would predict different results to two fundamental experiments: the measure of the force acting on a given passive test mass at a distance $R$ of the center of the source, or equivalently, its initial acceleration when falling from rest, and the comparison of two way transit times of light traveling into an optic fiber along a vertical direction and along a meridian. The last section describes how to find numeric, static and spherically symmetric, interior models with pre-selected mass $m$ and radius $R$ with $m/R&lt;1$ or $m/R&gt;1$ solving the horizon problem.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Two identical stopwatches moving at the same speed will elapse the same time after moving the same distance. If both stopwatches were started at the same time, there will be no time difference between these two stopwatches after both stopwatches have elapsed the same time. Both stopwatches will continue to show no time difference under identical acceleration. Therefore, both stopwatches show identical time in an accelerating reference frame if both stopwatches were restarted at the same time in a stationary reference frame.

<div class='title'>A Proposed Experiment to Test Theories of the Flyby Anomaly</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/c_k_raju">C. K. Raju</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We use Lorentz covariant retarded gravitation theory (RGT), without simplifications, to validate the earlier calculations for the flyby anomaly as a gravitational effect of Earth's rotation at the special relativistic (v/c) level. Small differences persist between the theoretical predictions of RGT and the data reported by Anderson et al. That reported data, however, is not direct observational data but consists of un-modeled residues. To settle doubts, we propose a 3-way experimental test to discriminate between RGT, Newtonian gravitation (no flyby anomaly), and Anderson et al.'s formula. This involves two satellites orbiting Earth in opposite directions in the equatorial plane in eccentric orbits. For these orbits, Earth's rotation should not affect velocity on (1) Newtonian gravitation and (2) the formula of Anderson et al. However, (3) on RGT, one satellite gains and the other loses velocity, by typically a few cm/s/day, which is easily measurable by satellite laser ranging.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper presents a simple and purely geometrical Grand Unification Theory. Quantum Gravity, Electrostatic and Magnetic interactions are shown in a unified framework. Newton's Gravitational Law, Gauss' Electrostatics Law and Biot-Savart's Electromagnetism Law are derived from first principles. Gravitational Lensing and Mercury Perihelion Precession are replicated within the theory. Unification symmetry is defined for all the existing forces. This alternative model does not require Strong and Electroweak forces. A 4D Shock-Wave Hyperspherical topology is proposed for the Universe which together with a Quantum Lagrangian Principle and a Dilator based model for matter result in a quantized stepwise expansion for the whole Universe along a radial direction within a 4D spatial manifold. The Hypergeometrical Standard Model for matter, Universe Topology and a new Law of Gravitation are presented. Newton's and Einstein's Laws of Gravitation and Dynamics, Gauss Law of Electrostatics among others are challenged when HU presents Type 1A Supernova Survey results. HU's SN1a results challenge current Cosmological Standard Model (L-CDM) by challenging its Cosmological Ruler d(z). SDSS BOSS dataset is shown to support a new Cosmogenesis theory and HU proposal that we are embedded in a 5D Spacetime. The Big Bang Theory is shown to be challenged by SDSS BOSS dataset. Hyperspherical Acoustic Oscillations are demonstrated in the SDSS BOSS Galaxy density. A New de-Broglie Force is proposed.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_d_bock">Robert D. Bock</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We present a simple model of light propagation that allows for the one-way speed of light, or equivalently, the simultaneity convention, to depend on the distance between the emitter and the absorber. This is distinct from variable speed of light (VSL) theories that assume the two-way speed of light is variable. We show that this model predicts wavelength shifts that are consistent with wavelength shifts measured from light propagating on astrophysical scales, thus eliminating the need to propose ad hoc mechanisms, such as dark matter, dark energy, and cosmological expansion.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/evgeny_a_novikov">Evgeny A. Novikov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Quantum modification of general relativity (Qmoger) is supported by cosmic data (without fitting). Qmoger equations consist of Einstein equations with two additional terms responsible for production/absorption of matter. In Qmoger cosmology there was no Big Bang and matter is continuously producing by the Vacuum. Particularly, production of the ultralight gravitons with tiny electric dipole moment (EDM) was started about 284 billion years ago. Quantum effects dominate interaction of these particles and they form the quantum condensate. Under influence of gravitation, the condensate is forming galaxies and producing ordinary matter, including photons. As one important result of this activity, it recently created us, the people, and continues to support us. Particularly, our subjective experiences are a result of an interaction between the background condensate and the neural system of the brain. The action potentials of neural system create traps and coherent dynamic patterns in the dipolar condensate. So, our subjective experiences are graviton-based. Some problems with the origin of life can also be clarified by taking into account the background dipolar condensate. It seems natural to call this graviton condensate bright matter. It not only produced ordinary matter, including light, but also produced and nurturing conscious life, as we know it, and, perhaps, some other forms of life in the universe. EDM of gravitons is small and existing telescopes can not see them, but we actually see bright matter in our subjective experiences. So, cosmology and brain science must work together to investigate bright matter, which will be the most important enterprise of humankind,</div>

<div class='abstract'>When confronted with the challenge of defining distant simultaneity Einstein looked down two roads that seemingly diverged. One road led to a theory based on backward null cone simultaneity and the other road led to a theory based on standard simultaneity. He felt that alone he could not travel both. After careful consideration he looked down the former and then took the latter. Sadly, years hence, he did not return to the first. In the following we investigate Einstein's road not taken, i.e., the road that leads to a theory based on backward null cone simultaneity. We show that both roads must be traveled to develop a consistent quantum theory of gravity and also to understand the relationship between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The time dependence of the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the cosmic fluid, for a space of zero curvature, has been determined in the framework of the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity, using FRW metric. For this purpose, empirical expressions of the scale factor, scalar field and the dimensionless BD parameter have been used. The constant parameters involved in these expressions have been determined from the field equations. The dependence of the scalar field upon the scale factor and the dependence of the BD parameter upon the scalar field have been explored to determine the time dependence of the EoS parameter. Its rate of change with time has been found to depend upon a parameter that governs the time dependent behavior of the scalar field. Time dependence of the EoS parameter has been graphically depicted.</div>

Consequently, the wave detector will detect different speeds from both waves due to the same wavelength and the different frequencies.

<div class='abstract'>Because the Einstein equation can't uniquely determine the metric, it must be supplemented by additional metric constraints. Since the Einstein equation can be derived in a purely special-relativistic context, those constraints (which can't be generally covariant) should be Lorentz-covariant; moreover, for the effect of the constraints to be natural from the perspective of observational and empirical physical scientists, they should also constrain the general coordinate transformations (which are compatible with the unconstrained Einstein equation) so that the constrained transformations manifest a salient feature of the Lorentz transformations. The little-known Einstein-Schwarzschild coordinate condition, which requires the metric's determinant to have its -1 Minkowski value, thereby constrains coordinate transformations to have unit Jacobian, and for that reason causes tensor densities to transform as true tensors, which is a salient feature of the Lorentz transformations. The Einstein-Schwarzschild coordinate condition also allows the static Schwarzschild solution's singular radius to be exactly zero; though another coordinate condition that allows zero Schwarzschild radius exists, it isn't Lorentz-covariant.</div>

<div class='title'>The Relativistic Mass Ratio in Ultrarelativistic Photon Rockets</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we take a closer look at the initial mass relative to the relativistic mass of the payload for an ideal photon rocket travelling at its maximum velocity. Haug has recently suggested that for all known subatomic particles, a minimum of two Planck masses of fuel are needed to accelerate the fundamental particle to its suggested maximum velocity (see [1]). Here we will show how this view is consistent with insight given by Tipler at a NASA Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Workshop Proceedings in 1999 (see [2]). Tipler suggested that the mass ratio of the initial rest mass of an ultra-relativistic rocket relative to the relativistic mass of the payload is likely &#8220;just&#8221; two. An ultrarelativistic rocket is one travelling at a velocity very close to the speed of light. We will here show that the Tipler factor is consistent with results derived from Haug&#8217;s suggested maximum velocity for any known observed subatomic particle. However, we will show that the Tipler factor of two is unlikely to hold for ultra-heavy subatomic particle payloads. With ultra-heavy particles, we think of subatomic particles with mass close to that of the Planck mass. Our analysis indicates that the initial mass relative to the relativistic mass of the payload for any type of subatomic particle rocket must be between one and two. Remarkably, the mass ratio is only one for a Planck mass particle. This at first sounds absurd until we understand that the Planck mass particle is probably the very collision point between two photons. Even if a photon&#8217;s speed &#8220;always is&#8221; considered to be the speed of light, we can think of it as standing still at the instant it collides with another photon (backscattering). The mass ratio to accelerate a particle that only exists at velocity zero is naturally one. This is true since no fuel is needed to go from zero to zero velocity. Remarkably this indicates that the Planck mass particle and the Planck length likely are invariant. This can only happen if the Planck mass particle only lasts for an instant before it bursts into energy, which is what we could expect for the collision between two photons.</div>

<div class='abstract'>It is commonly believed that the self-rotation angular momentum of planets is due to an original angular momentum of dense interstellar clouds at the formation stage of the stars. However, the study shows something completely dierent: a test planet in free-fall, in fact, follows two geodesics; the rst is the usual Schwarzschild path, and the second is a Schwarzschild-like path, dened (spatially) locally: an elliptical orbit in the plane (U(1)-variable, azimuthal angle). The analysis leads to the fact that: the motion along these geodesics (physically) is exactly the self-rotation of a charged test planet in Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The results reveal a more general understanding of Einstein equivalence principle: locally, gravitational eld can be (in the Reissner- Nordstrom space) replaced with an accelerated and rotated local frame.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eric_su">Eric Su</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Translational symmetry in one-dimensional space requires the distance between two objects moving at equal speed under equal acceleration to be constant in time. However, motion between the object and the observer is relative. Therefore, this distance is constant in time for an accelerating observer. Consequently, the length of an accelerating object is constant in time. The length of an moving object in the direction of motion is independent of its speed.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Length contraction is a principal feature of the Special Theory of Relativity. It is purported to be independent of position, being a function only of uniform relative velocity, via systems of clock-synchronised stationary observers and the Lorentz Transformation. However, a system of stationary observers reports not length contraction but length expansion. Two observers in a system of clock-synchronised observers assign a common length contraction, but at the expense of time dilation and of being stationary. Systems of clock-synchronised stationary observers are logically inconsistent with the Lorentz Transformation.

<div class='abstract'>Einstein's method of synchronising clocks in his Special Theory of Relativity is inconsistent with the Lorentz Transformation, despite the latter being a fundamental component of his theory. This inconsistency subverts the very foundations of Special Relativity because it follows that Einstein's time dilation and length contraction are also quite generally inconsistent with the Lorentz Transformation. Moreover, clock synchronisation is inconsistent with the Lorentz Transformation. Clock synchronisation and the Lorentz Transformation are mutually exclusive.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Here we examine maximum proper velocity (sometimes referred to as celerity), based on the recently suggested maximum velocity for anything with rest mass, as given by Haug. Proper velocity is a quantity that has been suggested for use in a series of calculations in relativity theory. Current standard theory imposes no limit on how close to infinity the proper velocity for an object with mass can be. Under our extended theory, by contrast, there is a strict upper limit on the proper velocity for anything with rest mass, which again is directly related to our newly suggested maximum velocity for anything with rest mass.</div>

<div class='title'>The Analysis of Chris Van Den Broeck Applied to the Natario Warp Drive Spacetime Using the Original Alcubierre Shape Function to Generate the Broeck Spacetime Distortion:the Natario-Broeck Warp Drive</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However the major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy density able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!!. With the correct form of the shape function the Natario warp drive can overcome this obstacle at least in theory.Other drawbacks that affects the warp drive geometry are the collisions with hazardous interstellar matter(asteroids,comets,interstellar dust etc)that will unavoidably occurs when a ship travels at superluminal speeds and the problem of the Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime).The geometrical features of the Natario warp drive are the required ones to overcome these obstacles also at least in theory.Some years ago in $1999$ Chris Van Den Broeck appeared with a very interesting idea.Broeck proposed a warp bubble with a large internal radius able to accommodate a ship inside while having a submicroscopic outer radius and a submicroscopic contact external surface in order to better avoid the collisions against the interstellar matter.The Broeck spacetime distortion have the shape of a bottle with $200$ meters of inner diameter able to accommodate a spaceship inside the bottle but the bottleneck possesses a very small outer radius with only $10^{-15}$ meters $100$ billion time smaller than a millimeter therefore reducing the probabilities of collisions against large objects in interstellar space.In this work we apply the Broeck idea to the Natario warp drive spacetime but out bottle have $200$ kilometers of inner size $1000$ times the size of the original Broeck bottle and we use the original Alcubierre shape function to generate our version of the Broeck bottle with very low energy density requirements.The Broeck idea is more than welcome and solves definitively the problem of the collisions against large objects. Any future development for the Natario warp drive must encompass the Broeck bottle and this approach must be named as the Natario-Broeck warp drive.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/miroslav_pardy">Miroslav Pardy</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We derive the Poincar&#180;e model of the Lobachevsky geometry from the Fermat principle. The Lobachevsky geometry is interpreted as the Lobachevsky-Beltrami-Fok velocity space geometry of moving particles. The relation of this geometry to the decay of the neutral &#960;-meson is considered. The generalization of the Lobachevsky geometry is performed and the new angle of parallelism is derived. Then, we determine nonlinear transformations between coordinate systems which are mutually in a constant symmetrical accelerated motion. The maximal acceleration limit follows from the kinematic origin. Maximal acceleration is an analogue of the maximal velocity in special relativity. We derive the dependence of mass, length, time, Doppler effect, on acceleration as an analogue phenomena in special theory of relativity. We apply the derived nonlinear Lorentz group to the so called Thomas precession. The total quantum energy loss of binary is caused by the production of gravitons emitted by the rotation motion of binary. We have calculated it in the framework of the Schwinger theory of gravity for the situation where the gravitational propagator involves radiative corrections. We also derive the finite-temperature gravitational Cherenkov radiation involving radiative corrections. The graviton action in vacuum is generalized for the medium with the constant gravitational index of refraction. From this generalized action the power spectral formula of the Cherenkov radiation of gravitons is derived in the framework of the Schwinger theory at zero and nonzero temperature. The next text deals with non-relativistic quantum energy shift of H-atom electrons due to Gibbons-Hawking thermal bath. The seventh chapter deals with gravity as the deformation of the space time and it involves the light deflection by the screw dislocation. In conclusion, we consider the scientific and technological meaning and the perspectives of the results derived. Some parts of the complex are published in the reputable journals. 1</div>

<div class='abstract'>Using the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe as a background metric, purely General relativistic (classical) scalar metric perturbations are investigated for small bodies. For the approximation of a point-like perturbing mass in the closed FLRW universe, the scalar perturbation may be written in a form obeying precisely the Dirac equation up to a factor playing the role of Planck&#8217;s constant. A physical interpretation suggests the scalar perturbation in this form is the wavefunction of quantum mechanics. Such an interpretation indicates the nonlocality of gravitational energy/momentum in General relativity leads naturally to the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics. Some physical consequences and predictions are discussed and briefly explored.</div>

<div class='title'>The Ultimate Limits of the Relativistic Rocket Equation. The Planck Photon Rocket</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we look at the ultimate limits of a photon propulsion rocket. The maximum velocity for a photon propulsion rocket is just below the speed of light and is a function of the reduced Compton wavelength of the heaviest subatomic particles in the rocket. We are basically combining the relativistic rocket equation with Haug&#8217;s new insight in the maximum velocity for anything with rest mass; see [1, 2, 3]. An interesting new finding is that in order to accelerate any sub-atomic &#8220;fundamental&#8221; particle to its maximum velocity, the particle rocket basically needs two Planck masses of initial load. This might sound illogical until one understands that subatomic particles with different masses have different maximum velocities. This can be generalized to large rockets and gives us the maximum theoretical velocity of a fully-efficient and ideal rocket. Further, no additional fuel is needed to accelerate a Planck mass particle to its maximum velocity; this also might sound absurd, but it has a very simple and logical solution that is explained in this paper. This paper is Classified!</div>

<div class='title'>Einstein Versus Fitzgerald, Lorentz, and Larmor Length Contraction</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper discusses the similarities between Einstein&#8217;s length contraction and the FitzGerald, Lorentz, and Larmor length contraction. The FitzGerald, Lorentz, and Larmor length contraction was originally derived for only the case of a frame moving relative to the ether frame, and not for two moving frames. When extending the FitzGerald, Lorentz, and Larmor length transformation to any two frames, we will clearly see that it is different than the Einstein length contraction. Under the FitzGerald, Lorentz, and Larmor length transformation we get both length contraction and length expansion, and non-reciprocality, while under Einstein&#8217;s special relativity theory we have only length contraction and reciprocality. However, we show that there is a mathematical and logical link between the two methods of measuring length. This paper shows that the Einstein length contraction can be derived from assuming an anisotropic one-way speed of light. Further, we show that that the reciprocality for length contraction under special relativity is an apparent reciprocality due to Einstein-Poincar &#769;e synchronization. The Einstein length contraction is real in the sense that the predictions are correct when measured with Einstein-Poincar &#769;e synchronized clocks. Still we will claim that there likely is a deeper and more fundamental reality that is better described with the extended FitzGerald, Lorentz, and Larmor framework, which, in the special case of using Einstein-Poincar &#769;e synchonized clocks gives Einstein&#8217;s length contraction. The extended FitzGerald, Lorentz, and Larmor length contraction is also about length expansion, and it is not recipro- cal between frames. Still, when using Einstein synchronized clocks the length contraction is apparently reciprocal. An enduring, open question concerns whether or not it is possible to measure the one-way speed of light without relying on Einstein-Poincar &#769;e synchronization or slow clock transportation synchronization, and if the one-way speed of light then is anisotropic or isotropic. Several experiments performed and published claim to have found an anisotropic one-way speed of light. These experiments have been ignored or ridiculed, but in our view they should be repeated and investigated further.</div>

<div class='title'>Gravitational Clock: Near Space Proof-of-Concept Prior to Deep Space Measurement of G-Part I</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_benish">Richard Benish</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Motivated by the benefits of improving our knowledge of Newton's constant G, Feldman et al have recently proposed a new measurement involving a gravitational clock launched into deep space. The clock's mechanism is supposed to be the linear oscillation of a test mass falling back and forth along the length of a hole through the center of a spherical source mass. Similar devices &#8212; ones that would have remained in orbit around Earth &#8212; were proposed about 50 years ago for the same purpose. None of these proposals were ever carried out. Further back, in 1632 Galileo proposed the thought experiment of a cannonball falling into a hole through the center of Earth. Curiously, no one has yet observed the gravity-induced radial motion of a test object through the center of a massive body. Also known as a gravity-train, not a one has yet reached its antipodal destination. From this kind of gravitational clock, humans have not yet recorded a single tick. The well known reliability of Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravity may give confidence that the device will work as planned. Nevertheless, it is argued here that a less expensive apparatus &#8212; Small Low-Energy Non-Collider &#8212; ought to be built first, simply to prove that the operating principle is sound. Certain peculiar facts about Schwarzschild's interior solution are discussed here; and a novel way of interpreting gravitational effects will be presented in Part II, together adding support for the cautious advice to more thoroughly look before we leap to the outskirts of the Solar System.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This note discusses an absurdity that is rooted in the modern physics interpretation of Einstein's relativistic mass formula when v is very close to c. Modern physics (and Einstein himself) claimed that the speed of a mass can never reach the speed of light. Yet at the same time they claim that it can approach the speed of light without any upper limit on how close it could get to that special speed. As we will see, this leads to some absurd predictions. If we assert that a material system cannot reach the speed of light, an important question is then, ``How close can it get to the speed of light?&quot; Is there a clear-cut boundary on the exact speed limit for an electron, as an example? Or must we settle for a mere approximation?</div>

There are some information about escaping from black holes, event horizon lengths, viscosity of free space, re-derivation of Planck constants and infrastructure of some basic laws of existence mathematically as matter is directly dependent of geometric rules. Also, some elements were given for the readers to solve some required constants as the most sensitive manner. As the constants are not enough in the name of engineering, also finally I found a working algorithm out which reduces process number of the power series to process number of the quadratic equations like calculating a root of an integer as an irrational number by solving equation; so also it can be used to calculate trigonometric values in the best manner for simulations of the entire universe besides physical constants as irrational values.</div>

<div class='title'>The Universe is Static</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/david_f_crawford">David F. Crawford</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is shown that the light curve widths of type Ia supernovae do not have time dilation and that their magnitudes are consistent with a static universe. The standard analysis for type Ia supernovae uses a set of templates to overcome the intrinsic variation of the supernova light curves with wavelength. The reference light curves derived from this set of templates contain an anomaly in that at short wavelengths the width of the light curve is proportional to the emitted wavelength. Furthermore this anomaly is exactly what would be produced if supernovae at different redshifts did not have time dilation and yet time dilation corrections were applied. It is the specific nature of this anomaly that is evidence for a static universe. The lack of time dilation is confirmed by direct analysis of the original observations. It is also found that the peak flux density of the light curves in the reference templates had a strong dependence on wavelength that could be due to the use of an incorrect distance modulus. This dependence is investigated by computing the peak absolute magnitudes of type Ia supernovae observations from the original observations using a static cosmological model. The results support the hypothesis of a static universe. It is also argued that the photometric redshift relation and spectroscopic ages are consistent with a static universe.</div>

This paper builds significantly on the maximum velocity for subatomic particles introduced by [1, 2, 3] and I strongly recommend reading an earlier paper [1] before reading this paper. It is important that we distinguish between Planck momentum and the momentum of a Planck mass. The Planck momentum can (almost) be reached for any subatomic particles with rest-mass lower than a Planck mass when accelerated to their maximum velocity, given by Haug. Just before the Planck momentum is reached, the mass will turn into a Planck mass. The Planck mass is surprisingly at rest for an instant, and then the mass will then burst into pure energy. This may sound illogical at first, but the Planck mass is the very turning point of the light particle (the indivisible particle) and it is the only mass that is at rest as observed from any reference frame. That the Planck mass is at rest as observed from any reference frame could be as important as understanding that the speed of light is the same in every reference frame. The Planck mass seems to be as unique and special among masses (particles with mass) as the speed of light is among velocities. It is likely one of the big missing pieces towards a unified theory.</div>

<div class='title'>Geometric Model of Time</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/[alik]_vitali_perakh">[Alik] Vitali Perakh</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The purpose of this article is to provide an alternative, strictly geometric, interpretation for the observed phenomenon of time. This Geometric Model of Time (GMT) is consistent with both Theories of Relativity but goes beyond cur- rent explanations for the nature of and the apparent one-directness of time - the so-called Arrow of Time. Key elements of the model are: 1. Our physical space (not space-time) is a 4-dimensional phenomenon. The notion of a dimension of time that is distinct from space is not necessary for a complete description of our universe. All dimensions are identical and symmetrical. No one dimension can be singled out to be universally or uniquely labeled as &quot;time&quot; or be otherwise unique. 2. All physical objects in our universe are endowed with an axiomatic vectorial property we call velocity. The scalar value of this property (speed) is invariable and identical for all objects and is labeled as c (speed of light). 3. The experience of time as we know it, or, more precisely, of sequential causality, results from each observer's motion through space at c. &quot;Time&quot; is the term given by each observer to their own individual direction of travel in our physical four-space. This model is a better fit with observed phenomena than current ones as well as being simpler and more elegant, elegance being defined as having symmetry (in the sense that it treats no dimension as being singular).</div>

<div class='abstract'>In a recent publication [J. D. Anderson at al. (2015)', Europhys. Lett. 110, 10002] presented a strong correlation between the measured values of the Newtonian gravitational constant G and the 5.9 year oscillation of the length of day. Following this publication of Anderson at al. (2015)'s publication, S. Schlamminger at al. [Phys. Rev. D 91, 121101(R)] compiled a more complete set of published measurements of G made in the last 35 years where they performed a least-squares regression to a sinusoid with period 5.9 years and found this fit to still yields a reasonable fit to these data thus somewhat putting credence to this claim of Anderson at al. (2015). However, it is yet to be established as to whether or not this signal is gravitational in origin. In this brief communication, we point-out that -- in principle -- this sinusoidal signal has a place in the gravitomagnetic model that we currently working on.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In an earlier reading, it is argued that the pivotal, all-important, critical, crucial and supposedly watershed factor &quot; 2 &quot; emerging from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GTR) and used in Solar eclipse measurements by Sir Arthur S. Eddington as the clearest indicator yet that Einstein's GTR is indeed a superior theory to Newton's theory of gravitation may not be adequate as an arbiter to decide the fate of Newtonian gravitational theory. In the present reading, using ideas from research that we have carried out over the years &#8211; research whose endeavour is to obtain a General Spin Dirac Equation in Curved Spacetime (GS-Dirac Equation); we present yet another &quot; surprising &quot; result, namely that &#8211; if the ideas leading to the GS-Dirac Equation and as-well those presented in the reading rendering the factor &quot; 2 &quot; as being inadequate as an arbiter to decide the fate of Newtonian gravitational theory, then, the gravitational deflection of a photon may very well depend on its spin in such a manner that if photons of different spins where to be observed undergoing gravitational deflection by a massive object such as the Sun, the resulting deflection may very well be seen exhibiting distinct deflection quantization as a result of the quantized spins.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We can propose two models as an example for Zero Energy Universe Model. In this paper, we research that the total energy of the universe is zero, matters have a positive energy, and only gravitational potential energy is considered as a negative energy to offset this positive energy. In this model, to establish energy conservation law while the universe is expanding, energy needs to be increased, which increases R_gs or R_B of the universe. If a newly appeared energy has antigravity or negative pressure characteristics, it can be used as the model that can account for dark energy. There exists a zone that has a uniform energy density within R_gs due to the presence of gravitational potential energy with negative values. Base on this, I estimated the current size of the universe. And the model that I propose can solve some problems that the model &#8220;the universe is a black hole&#8221; had.</div>

Ahluwalia et al. and by W. Rodrigues Jr. et al. The solution of this mathematical controversy is obvious. It is related to the necessary doubling of the Fock Space (as in the Barut and Ziino works), thus extending the corresponding Clifford Algebra. However, the logical interrelations of different mathematical foundations with the physical interpretations are not so obvious (Physics should choose only one correct formalism - it is not clear, why two correct mathematical formalisms (which are based on the same postulates) lead to different physical results?)</div>

<div class='title'>An Attempt to Explain Flyby Anomaly And to Account for the Anomalous Torque of the Gravity Probe-b Gyroscopes Using LITG</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mutasim_a_ahmed">Mutasim A. Ahmed</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>To explain the flyby anomaly we fully applied the equivalence principle, and we allowed the observer on-board the free-falling craft to claim the state of rest. The telemetry photons considered as particles possessing their mass due to their movement with the light speed. The telemetry photons assumed to generate their respective gravitomagnetic fields according to LITG. The telemetry photons were emitted from the craft and can only be judged by an observer on-board the craft. The observer on-board the spacecraft will claim that the Earth is moving relatively with his same velocity in the opposite direction. The effect will be detected by an observer on-board the craft, that is the frame of reference attached to the craft. The Earth will generate its respective gravitomagnetic field due to its relative motion as claimed by the observer on-board the craft. The flyby effect is highly dependent on the way we observe it, as we will show. As for the gravity probe-b case, we insisted that the equivalence principle must be fully applied. Therefore an observer in a free falling frame, have the right to claim being at rest, while the rest of the Universe will be moving with his same velocity, in the opposite direction. So from the point of view of the spinning gyroscope, Earth will be orbiting the gyroscope. We usually call this an apparent revolution. But for the gyroscope this apparent revolution of the Earth can produce measurable effects. Using this reasoning and applying the LITG we obtained a field which is about 105.39 times greater than the expected one.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Haug [1, 2] has recently shown there is a speed limit for fundamental particles just below the speed of light. This speed limit means that the mass of a fundamental particle not will go towards infinity as v approaches c in the Einstein relativistic mass equation. The relativistic mass limit for a fundamental particle is the Planck mass. In this paper we use the same velocity limit in the Lorentz transformation. This leads to what we think could be significant results with some interesting interpretations. In addition we look at rapidity as well as relativity of simultaneity for subatomic particles at this maximum velocity for masses.</div>

<div class='title'>A New Solution to Einstein's Infinite Mass Challenge Based on Maximum Frequency</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 1905, Einstein presented his famous relativistic mass energy equation mc^2/Sqrt(1-{v^2/c^2). When v approaches c, the expression containing the moving mass approaches infinity. Einstein interpreted this in the following way: since one needs an infinite amount of energy to accelerate even a small mass to the speed of light, it would appear that no mass can ever reach the speed of light. In this paper, we present a new solution to the infinite mass challenge based on combining special relativity with insights from Max Planck and maximum frequency. By doing this we show that there is an exact limit on the speed v in Einstein's formula. This limit is only dependent on the Planck length and the reduced Compton wavelength of the mass in question. This also gives us a limit on the maximum relativistic Doppler shift that is derived and discussed.</div>

<div class='title'>Characteristics of a One-Dimensional Universe Spanned Between a Local and a Non-Local Observer</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/erik_a_cerwen">Erik A. Cerwen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Special and general relativity theories are critically evaluated regarding their contemporary role as a foundation for a cosmological world picture. It is argued that the rest frame, where all physical processes take place, is more important in this role than the various relativistic distortions of these processes seen by different remote observers. This idea was previously formulated quantitatively with numerical examples from the Bohr atom, quantum physics and astrophysical observations. The theory identifies an observer on one local spatial dimension via Lorentz transformations connected with a space-like separated perpendicular observer who is non-local and only measures time. It was shown that this geometrical construction, where each unit local length comes with a line increment, is relevant both to the atom and to the universe. For example, the Planck length obtained from the Bohr atom could be expressed in terms of the apparent local Hubble expansion rate and the latter substituted into the Schroedinger equation to yield a circular current surrounding a magnetic pole. The distant non-local observer sees the radius Lorentz-contracted at relativistic speeds ultimately so much as to be able to contribute dynamics to the local frame, which was exemplified numerically by the CMBR. Evidence was also presented indicating that the oscillating line increment is capable of contributing mass from vacuum via the resonance particles. Elaborating on the latter idea indicates energy contributions of around 80, 90 and 125 GeV embedded in a robustly defined geometrical framework that has relevance (and even precedence) also in classical physics. The apparent transition from one to several spatial dimensions is exemplified by reinterpreting Compton scattering. The emergence of additional spatial dimensions and tangible locality are also discussed in terms of the number pi which appears by applying the Wallis product to the 1-D universe. The presence of the number pi thus indicates the presence of local particles as further exemplified by the CMBR and Compton scattering. The mass of the 1-D universe is obtained by considering local as well as non-local contributions as prescribed on the basis of the geometry. This yields corrections to the &#8216;classical&#8217; geometrised mass such that the universe&#8217;s baryon particle density visible on the local axis is close to its electron density. Several unrelated numerical approaches guided by the proposed geometry indicate that the particle density of a primordial universe is roughly 1/m^3 (1/m^2).</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mutasim_a_ahmed">Mutasim A. Ahmed</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Relative motion in the special theory of relativity, can have true and verifiable results. But we ignored it in the case of the rotation of Earth and other planets and cosmic objects, around their own axes. My aim is to find (Earth's Resultant Inertial Rotation) ERIR. This ERIR is resulting from the curved path due to gravity, and the circular path of an observer due to rotation, out of the whole rotation. And for this ERIR an observer can assume the state of rest, while the whole observable universe will be revolving relatively around him in the opposite direction. This (Universe's Relative Revolution) URR will be displayed in conformity with circular motion laws. I've found the equation to describe this type of ERIR . I used this equation, and postulated that aberration of the light of distant objects would allow us to see a component of the tangential velocity produced by the URR along our line of sight. I reinterpreted the Hubble phenomenon, and showed that the phenomenon is different for different cosmic objects, and predicted a blue-shift on the other side of the sky, mostly behind the zone of avoidance. The dependence of Hubble's constant on aberration angle is emphasized. Accordingly we concluded that, the great attractor, the Virgo infall, the CMB dipole, the dark energy, and the fingers of God theories and the likes, were based on illusions. All the anomalies of the CMB mapping, like the axis of evil, could naturally be explained. And the Pioneer effect, could also be explained, and the diurnal and annual variations of the effect also accounted for. Also it is possible using this global URR to find a Universal mechanism for magnetic field generation, which could be applied for all cosmic objects, from asteroids to magnetars and even galaxies. Using this idea I predicted a magnetic field on Ceres twice as that of Mercury. But only the outlines of this new mechanism will be given, so that other investigators could develop it further.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/yuri_heymann">Yuri Heymann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The universe is characterized by large concentrations of energy contained in small, dense areas such as galaxies, which radiate energy towards the surrounding space. However, no current theory balances the loss of energy of galaxies, a requirement for a conservative universe. This study is an investigation of the physics nature might use to maintain the energy di&#64256;erential between its dense parts and the vacuum. We propose time contraction as a principle to maintain this energy di&#64256;erential. Time contraction has the following e&#64256;ects: photons lose energy, while masses gain potential energy and lose kinetic energy. From the virial theorem, which applies to a system of bodies, we &#64257;nd that the net energy resulting from the gain in potential energy and the loss in kinetic energy remains unchanged, meaning that the orbitals of stars in galaxies remain una&#64256;ected by time contraction. However, each object in a galaxy has an internal potential energy leading to a surplus of energy within the object. This internal energy surplus should balance with the energy radiated at the level of a galaxy. We illustrate this principle with a calculation of the energy balance of the Milky Way.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we proposed a totally new mechanism for thrust production, to explain the working of the two reaction-less drives. Namely the EmDrive invented by Roger Shawyer, and the Cannae drive invented by Guido Fetta. The explanation based on a postulated potential or viable momentum deduced from the relativistic momentum energy relation. We assumed that by selectively adding energy to one object of a binary system made of two objects connected by a rigid mass-less rod, a viable momentum would be possessed by this object. We claimed that this will be the inverse of the momentum energy relation. We used the relativistic equivalence of mass and energy to show that the mass of the object where the energy is added will increase. This increase in mass will change the position of the center of mass of the binary system. We postulated that the claimed potential momentum will manifest as a true observable momentum in the direction of center of mass change. The added energy will be absorbed by the object's atoms and manifest as a kinetic energy. And according to the equivalence of all inertial frames of reference dictated by the special theory of relativity the system will be accelerating.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Using the Time Dilation equation, Length Contraction equation and Mass Increase equation, all derived within Special Relativity. With a simple substitution I convert the time dilation equation to a Pythagorean equation showing the observed time consists of two time components and I convert the length contraction equation to a Pythagorean equation showing the total length of a moving object has two length components. These new forms of the time dilation and length contraction equations strongly indicate the presence of a new Time Dimension and a new Space Dimension. The additional Time dimension explains exactly what time dilation is and together with the Mass Increase equation I introduce the concept of a Newtonian velocity, which is an alternative velocity of a moving object. I propose the mass of the moving object does not change, because we are in fact measuring momentum with the wrong velocity. The additional Space dimension in fact means length contraction does not occur because we are seeing the object at an angle within a four dimensional space, which means it looks shorter when viewed in three space dimensions only. These changes mean Special relativity IS compatible with Quantum Gravity and Doubly-Special Relativity is not required.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Referring to the behavior of accelerating objects in special relativity, and applying the principle of equivalence, one expects that the coordinate acceleration of point masses under gravity will be velocity dependent. Then, using the Schwarzschild solution, we analyze the similar case of masses moving on timelike geodesics, which reproduces a little known result by Hilbert from 1917, describing this dependence. We find that the relativistic correction term for the acceleration based on general relativity differs by a factor of two from the simpler acceleration arguments in flat space. As we might expect from the general theory, the velocity dependence can be removed by a suitable coordinate transformation, such as the Painlev&#180;e-Gullstrand coordinate system. The validity of this approach is supported by previous authors who have demonstrated vacuum solutions to general relativity producing true flat space metrics for uniform gravitational fields. We suggest explicit experiments could be undertaken to test the property of velocity dependence.</div>

<div class='title'>Can GR Lack &quot;Dark Energy&quot; or Abide a &quot;Big Bang&quot;?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 1922 Alexandre Friedmann obtained, in the context of an unusual spherically-symmetric metric form, formal solutions of the Einstein equation for dust of uniform energy density which as well apply within spherically symmetric dynamic dust balls of uniform energy density. The resulting Friedmann equation for the dynamical behavior of these ostensibly general-relativistic dust-ball solutions exclusively reflects, however, completely non-relativistic Newtonian gravitational dynamics, with no trace at all of the purely relativistic phenomenon of gravitational time dilation, notwithstanding that gravitational time dilation inescapably accompanies gravitation's presence in GR. That paradox wasn't noticed by Friedmann, nor has it since been consciously addressed. As a consequence, accepted dust-ball behavior is Newtonian gravitational in every respect, notably including compulsory deceleration of dust-ball expansion, as well as compulsory assumption by every expanding dust ball of a singular, zero-radius &quot;Big Bang&quot; configuration at a finite earlier time -- despite both behaviors being incompatible with the implications of gravitational time dilation. The source of these inconsistencies is the GR-incompatible nature of Friedmann's unusual metric form, which extinguishes relativistic gravitational and speed time dilation by implicitly utilizing the GR-inaccessible set of clock readings of an infinite number of different observers. However in 1939 Oppenheimer and Snyder carried out a tour-de-force analytic space-time transformation of a Friedmann GR-unphysical dust-ball solution which satisfies a particular initial condition to fully GR-physical &quot;standard&quot; metric form. That Oppenheimer-Snyder transformation was recently extended to arbitrary dust-ball initial conditions, yielding the equation of motion in fully GR-physical &quot;standard&quot; coordinates of any dust ball's radius. This non-Newtonian GR-physical dust-ball radius equation of motion fully conforms to the implications of gravitational time dilation: it in no way forbids acceleration of dust-ball expansion, but it prevents, at any finite &quot;standard&quot; time whatsoever, any dust ball's radius from being smaller than or equal to its Schwarzschild radius-value. Full GR conformity thus needs no &quot;dark energy&quot;, but can't support a &quot;Big Bang&quot;.</div>

<div class='title'>The Holochronous Universe: Time to Shed Some Light on the Dark Sector?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robin_booth">Robin Booth</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We describe a novel interpretation of the time dimension in General Relativity: the Holochronous Principle, and show that the application of this principle in standard cosmological situations is able fully to account for the effects currently attributed to Dark Matter in observational phenomena such as galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing. We re-evaluate the role of the Friedman equations in defining a time varying spacetime metric, and in their place postulate a model that is based on the `shrinkage' of baryons in a gravitational field to account for the dynamical behaviour of the cosmic scale factor. We show that integrating the Holochronous Principle into this model gives rise to a solution that takes the form of a resonant universe, in which the resultant damped oscillations can account for the observed accelerating expansion rate of the universe, to a greater level of precision than the standard &#923;CDM model. The Holochronous model obviates the need for Dark Energy in the form of a cosmological constant, &#923;, and also resolves other issues associated with the &#923;CDM model, including the &#8486;=1 flatness problem.</div>

We show that the coupling introduced an extra amount of charge and current density--the electromagnetic and gravitoelectric--which resulting in non vanishing divergence of the magnetic filed tensor, this is equivalent to a magnetic monopole density. This is similar to the result that found by Piplowski, which states that such a coupling breaks the symmetry of $U(1)$ group, and has only significant at early time of the universe or inside black holes where the energy is very high.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The search of a logical quantum gravity theory is one of the noteworthy issues in modern theoretical physics. It is known that most of the quantum gravity theories describe our universe as a dimensional flow. From this point of view, one can investigate whether and how these attractive properties are related with the ultraviolet-divergence problem. These important points motivated us to discuss the reconstruction of a scalar field problem in the fractal theory which is a well-known quantum theory of gravity. Making use of time-like fractal model and considering the holographic description of galactic dark energy, we implement a correspondence between the tachyon model of galactic dark energy effect and holographic energy. Such a connection gives us an opportunity to redefine the fractal dynamics of selected scalar field representation by considering the time-evolution of holographic energy.</div>

<div class='title'>Is &quot;Dark Energy&quot; Just an Effect of Gravitational Time Dilation?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>When an expanding uniform-density dust ball's radius doesn't sufficiently exceed the Schwarzschild value, its expansion rate will actually be increasing because the dominant gravitational time dilation effect diminishes as the dust ball expands. But such acceleration of expansion is absent in &quot;comoving coordinates&quot; because the &quot;comoving&quot; fixing of the 00 component of the metric tensor to unity extinguishes gravitational time dilation, as is evidenced in the &quot;comoving&quot; FLRW dust-ball model by the Newtonian form of its Friedmann equation of motion. Therefore we extend to all dust-ball initial conditions the singular Oppenheimer-Snyder transformation from &quot;comoving&quot; to &quot;standard&quot; coordinates which they carried out for a particular initial condition. In &quot;standard&quot; coordinates relativistic time dilation is manifest in the equations of motion of the dynamical radii of all of the dust ball's interior shells; the acceleration of expansion of the surface shell peaks when its radius is only fractionally larger than the dust ball's Schwarzschild radius. Even so, for a range of initial conditions a dust ball's expansion continues accelerating at all &quot;standard&quot; times, although that acceleration asymptotically decreases toward zero. Attempts to account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe by fitting a nonzero &quot;dark energy&quot; cosmological constant thus seem to be quite unnecessary.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper we show how Einstein's relativity of simultaneity is fully consistent with anisotropic one-way speed of light. We get the same end result and observations as predicted by Einstein, but with a very different interpretation. We show that the relativity of simultaneity is an apparent effect due to an Einstein clock synchronization error, which is rooted in assuming that the one-way speed of light is the same as the well-tested round-trip speed of light. Einstein's relativity of simultaneity leads to several bizarre paradoxes recently introduced by Haug (2016a, 2016b).</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper introduces a new way to synchronize clocks distanced apart and a way to synchronize clocks between reference frames. Based on a simple synchronization thought experiment, we claim that relativity of simultaneity must be incomplete. Einstein's special relativity theory predicts relativity of simultaneity and that two events that happen simultaneously in one reference frame will not happen simultaneously as observed from another reference frame. Relativity of simultaneity is directly linked to a particular way of synchronizing clocks (Einstein-Poincar\'{e} synchronization) that again assumes that the one-way speed of light is isotropic and identical with the well-tested round-trip speed of light. In the new thought experiment introduced here, there is reason to believe that two distant events can happen simultaneously in both frames. Still, we agree that these events will not happen simultaneously as measured with Einstein synchronized clocks. The claim here is that Einstein synchronized clocks lead to apparent relativity of simultaneity due to a clock synchronization error rooted in the assumption of isotropic one-way speed of light.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Although many experiments have been cited as empirical verification of special relativity, they are not experiments that could not have questions raised about their validity as proofs. There is one simple experiment that could be carried out to put to rest, incontrovertibly, the controversies concerning the validity of special relativity - by a direct measurement of the speed of beta particles from beta decay. If special relativity is correct, no electrons would be found to go faster than light speed. If special relativity is invalid, then kinetic energy obeys the old 1 / 2 mv2 formula. Some beta particles could be ejected with kinetic energy greater than 1 MeV; such electrons would be detected to travel at about twice the speed of light. Though it is one of the simplest experiment that many laboratories over the world could perform,until now, the experiment has yet to be carried out.</div>

<div class='abstract'>It is a mistake to believe that the primitive experiments, known as the origin of the physical sciences, have been sufficiently studied and therefore it is impossible to extract from them some new and important knowledge. This view has contributed to the perpetuation of some misconceptions. The study of such experiments from other points of view, and applying new techniques, makes it possible to expand their meaning and understanding. Einstein must have thought this way since in 1905 decided to study the Faraday disk and, by doing so, discovered the theory of relativity, according to which the magnetic field is a consequence of the relative motion of different signs electric charges. The verifications of the theory of general relativity by cosmological experiments have led to the belief that the special relativity theory is irrelevant in terrestrial dimensions and speed. Therefore, it is important to correct this error by simple laboratory experiments, whose explanation is only possible by using special relativity theory.</div>

In his article, Sharples has committed several major errors, and resorted to language unbefitting a publicly funded professorship when addressing the person of Crothers. After some rolling preamble, Sharples disputes two matters addressed by Crothers: (a) Einstein&#8217;s Principle of Equivalence, (b) Einstein&#8217;s pseudotensor. In the first case Sharples incorrectly argues that multiple arbitrarily large finite masses are not involved in its definition. In the second case he failed to understand the problem and thereby expounded upon an entirely different matter that was never contested by Crothers in the first place - Sharples confounded the Einstein tensor for Einstein&#8217;s pseudotensor and consequently did not even address the issue.</div>

What arises is that parallel to the real three dimensional $SO(3)_l$ space there is a coexisting dual space called potentia space $SO(3)_p$, wherein velocity $c \rightarrow \infty$. How does this affect gravity? We show here that gravity actually sits in the space of potentia. The space of potentia does not allow gauging. Thus gravity is not quantized.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/reginald_t_cahill">Reginald T Cahill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The LIGO team, operating two vacuum-mode Michelson interferometers reported the detection, on September 14, 2015, of a gravitational wave event of some 0.2sec duration, which was claimed to have been generated by two black holes merging a billion years ago. However experimentally it has been shown that such vacuum mode interferometers have zero sensitivity to gravitational waves, which have indeed been detected using other techniques over the last 100+ years. One such recently discovered technique uses quantum barrier electron tunnelling current fluctuations in reverse biased diodes, generated by dynamical 3-space fluctuations: gravitational waves. These are Quantum Gravity Detectors (QGD). There happens to be an international network of such detectors, and the data from this network shows a significant event at the same time as the LIGO event, but extending over some 4sec duration. Previously in 2014 such Quantum Gravity Detectors detected gravitational waves generated by the resonant Earth vibrations, whose frequencies were known from seismology. It is suggested that the LIGO event may have been an Earth generated gravitational wave event that was detected by the electronics of the LIGO measuring and recording system, an effect previously discovered in 2014 using time-delayed correlated fluctuations in data recorded by oscilloscopes located in Australia and London.</div>

<div class='abstract'>There are theories related to the time dependence of the speed of light that predict that the speed of light is not constant but depends on the time. But they are not verifiable or demonstrable physically or mathematically with concrete results. In this study, based on simple assumptions on the microwave background and thermal electrons, a model of the time varying speed of light is presented, which is fully compatible with currently accepted results for the speed of light and the Hubble constant theories.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Thermodynamic formalism for rotating black holes, characterized by noncommutative and quantum corrections, is constructed. From a fundamental thermodynamic relation, equations of state and thermodynamic response functions are explicitly given and the effect of noncommutativity and quantum correction is discussed. It is shown that the well known divergence exhibited in specific heat is not removed by any of these corrections. However, regions of thermodynamic stability are affected by noncommutativity, increasing the available states for which the system is thermodynamically stable.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/marcelo_carvalho">Marcelo Carvalho</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We provide a categorical interpretation for a model unifying the Galilei relativity and the special relativity, which is based on the introduction of two times variables, one associated to the absolute time of the Galilei relativity, and the other to the local time of the special relativity. The relation between these two time variables is the key point for the construction of a natural transformation relating two functors $\ol G$ and $\ol L$ that translates to the framework of category the role of the Galilei and the Lorentz transformations bringing with them a decomposition of the Lorentz transformation in terms of the Galilei transformation, which in some sense unify both relativities.</div>

<div class='title'>Determining the Radius of the Observable Universe Using a Time-Scaled 3-Sphere Model of the Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_tassano">James A. Tassano</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Observation: Treating the observable universe as the surface volume of a 3-sphere allows us to produce a simple equation for the radius of the observable universe. By taking the ratio of the standard three dimensional volumes for the observable universe to the Hubble volume, and setting it equal to the ratio of the corresponding volumes derived using the equations for the surface volume of a 3-sphere, we can solve for the radius of the observable universe. We find that this radius to be the cube root of 12 pi, times the Hubble radius, or 46.27 billion light years, which matches the accepted figures. The volume of the observable universe is shown to be larger than the Hubble volume by a factor of 12 pi. This gives us a simple expression for the radius and volume of the observable universe, derived from the geometry of a 3-sphere. Explanation: But the whole universe is vastly larger than the observable, and the observable universe is not a 3-sphere, forcing us to explain how this artificial 3-sphere, clearly smaller than what the true 3-sphere would be, can show such behavior. We use the argument from another hyperverse paper, on quantum time, that the relative increase in the unit of quantum time cancels the rapidly increasing growth rate of the whole hyperverse, resulting in a constant, 2c radial expansion rate. This allows the observable universe to be treated, in many respects, as a stand-alone hyperverse, a time-scaled version of the whole. This time-scaling gives the observable universe many of the properties of a 3-sphere.</div>

<div class='title'>Baryogenesis Via the Packaged Entanglement States with C-Symmetry Breaking</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/rongchao_ma">Rongchao Ma</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Baryogenesis, or the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, is one of the major unsolved problems in physical cosmology. Here we present a new interpretation to the baryogenesis based on the theory of packaged entanglement states in which the particles are indeterminate and hermaphroditic. A measurement or an external perturbation to these packaged entanglement states will cause the wave function to collapse and therefore break the system's C-symmetry. This process satisfies the Sakharov conditions. By further proposing an entanglement selection principle, we can give a self-consistent interpretation to the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry produced in early universe. Thus, the collapse of packaged entanglement states with C-symmetry breaking could be or at lease contribute to the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/osvaldo_domann">Osvaldo Domann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Special Relativity derived by Einstein presents time and space distorsions and paradoxes. This paper presents an approach where the Lorenz transformations are build on equations with speed variables instead of space and time variables as done by Einstein. The result are transformation rules between inertial frames that are free of time dilation and length contraction for all relativistiv speeds. Particles move according to Galilei relativity multiplied with the relativistic Gamma factor. All the transformation equations already existent for the electric and magnetic fields, deduced on the base of the invariance of the Maxwell wave equations are still valid. The present work shows the importance of including the characteristics of the measuring equipment in the chain of physical interactions to avoid unnatural conclusions like time dilation and lengthcontraction.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/osvaldo_domann">Osvaldo Domann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The present paper makes a comparison between two different approaches for Relativity Theories. One is the approach made by Einstein at the beginning of the 20th century which postulates that light moves with light speed c independent of its emitting source. The proposed approach postulates that light moves with light speed c relative to its emitting source, which also includes the reflecting and refracting surfaces. Einstein interpreted the constancy of light speed in all inertial frames as a time and space problem resulting time dilation and length contraction, while the new approach considers it a speed problem where time and space are absolute variables. The result of the proposed approach is that particles move according Galilei relativity multiplied with the relativistic gamma factor.</div>

<div class='title'>Fitting the Hyperverse Model into the Friedmann Equation Gives a Constant Expansion Rate for the Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_tassano">James A. Tassano</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We show that a 3-sphere, whose surface volume matches the volume of the observable universe, has a radius of 27.6 billion light years, meaning it would be expanding into the fourth dimension at exactly twice the speed of light. We claim this observation has deep significance. Although the whole universe is much larger than this 'observable hyperverse', the 2c expansion rate is the actual expansion rate we experience, and this is due to the increase in the duration of the unit of quantum time as the universe expands. A model of the universe based on the 2c radial expansion rate produces equations stating that both energy and matter are continuously created with expansion, starting at the time of the Big Bang. Placing these equations into the Friedmann equation also gives a constant rate of expansion. The continuous creation of matter and energy, starting with the Big Bang, is distinct from the Steady State model, which has no Big Bang. The universe as an expanding 3-sphere is not an FRW model, as energy and matter both change with one over the scale factor squared. This negates most arguments against constant-rate expansion, as they are based on the FRW model. A 2c-hyperverse cosmology provides a new, powerful model for exploring the nature of the universe.</div>

<div class='title'>GR as a Nonsingular Classical Field Theory</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Thirring and Feynman showed that the Einstein equation is simply a partial differential classical field equation, akin to Maxwell's equation, but it and its solutions are required to conform to the GR principles of general covariance and equivalence. It is noted, with examples, that solutions of such equations can contravene required physical principles when they exhibit unphysical boundary conditions. Using the crucially important tensor contraction theorem together with the equivalence principle, it is shown that metric tensors are physical only where all their components, and also those of their inverse matrix, are finite real numbers, and their signature is that of the Minkowski metric. Thus the &quot;horizons&quot; of the empty-space Schwarzschild solution metrics are unphysical, which is traced to the boundary condition that arises from the minimum energetically-allowed radius of a positive effective mass. It is also noted that &quot;comoving&quot; ostensible &quot;coordinate systems&quot; disrupt physical boundary conditions in time via their artificial &quot;composite time&quot; which can't be registered by the clock of any observer because it is &quot;defined&quot; by the clocks of an infinite number of observers. Spurious singularities ensue in such unphysical &quot;coordinates&quot;, which fall away on transformation of metric solutions to non-&quot;comoving coordinates&quot;.</div>

The cosmology proposed by Dicke would have been in full agreement with Dirac's Large Number Hypothesis, had Dicke not gone astray at that decisive step. Instead of igniting the dispute with Dirac that followed (R. Dicke, Nature 192 (1961), p. 440; P. A. M.

<div class='abstract'>Mass and electric dipole moment of graviton, which is identified as dark matter particle, are estimated. This change the concept of dark matter and can help to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. The calculations are based on quantum modification of the general relativity with two additional terms in the Einstein equations, which takes into account production/absorption of gravitons. In this theory, there are no Big Bang in the beginning (some local bangs during the evolution of the universe are probable), no critical density of the universe, no dark energy (no need in cosmological constant) and no inflation. The theory (without fitting) is in good quantitative agreement with cosmic data. Key words: graviton; cosmology; age of the universe; interface between gravitons and ordinary matter.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/e_p_j_de_haas">E.P.J. de Haas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper I continue with the elementary particle Dark Matter halo model. The first few sections will shortly repeat the basics of this model. In section II I take a better look at the modified Newtonian potential as a consequence of the changed source mass. In section VI the effect of the modified potential on Einstein lensing is touched briefly. In sections VII and VIII the order stored in the frequency gauge of the de Broglie time devices in the outer galactic disks due to Dark Matter is related to entropy. The study of order stored in frequency synchronized or desynchronized time devices is called chronodynamics and this is added to the thermodynamics part of entropy. We show that in the inner galactic range thermodynamic entropy dominates chronodynamic entropy but that in the outer flat rotation curve part of the galactic disks the chronodynamic entropy dominates by far. We show that the chronodynamic entropy of a galaxy is lowest in its outer fringes and highest in its luminous center. This creates an inward entropic force and that is how the Dark Matter halo, through the intermediate of chronodynamic entropy, stabilizes galaxies. The frequency gauge of the de Broglie elementary time devices in the outer range of galactic disks creates a sort of a gauged time bubble in a cosmic time sea, a gauge regulated by the BTF relation. In the last section we relate this galactic gauged time bubble to GR as a reference frame independent theory of gravity.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/johan_noldus">Johan Noldus</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We start by rewriting classical mechanics in a quantum mechanical fashion and point out that the only di&#64256;erence with quantum theory re- sides at one point. There is a classical analogon of the collapse of the wavefunction and an extension of the usual Born rule is proposed which might solve this problem. We work only with algebra&#8217;s over the real (com- plex) numbers, general number &#64257;elds of &#64257;nite characteristic allowing for &#64257;nite dimensional representations of the commutation relations are not considered given that such &#64257;elds are not well ordered and do not give rise to a well de&#64257;ned probability interpretation. Our theory generalizes however to discrete spacetimes and &#64257;nite dimensional algebra&#8217;s. Looking at physics this way, spacetime itself distinguishes itself algebraically by means of well chosen commutation relations and there is further nothing special about it meaning it has also a particle interpretation just like any other dynamical variable. Likewise, there is no reason for the dynamics to be Hamiltonian and therefore we have a nonconservative formulation of quantum physics at hand. The harmonic oscillator (amongst few oth- ers) distinguishes itself because the algebra forms a &#64257;nite dimensional Lie algebra; the classical and quantum (discrete) harmonic oscillator are stud- ied in a some more generality and examples are given which are neither classical, nor quantum.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/evgeny_a_novikov">Evgeny A. Novikov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This work is based on modification of the general relativity, which includes effects of production /absorption of matter by the vacuum. The theory (without fitting parameters) is in good quantitative agreement with cosmological observations (SnIa, SDSS-BAO and reduction of acceleration of the expanding universe). In this theory, there is no Big Bang at the beginning, but some local bangs during the evolution are probable. Also, there is no critical density of the universe and, therefore, no dark energy. Based on exact Gaussian solution for the scale factor, it is shown that an effective age of the universe is about 327 billion years. Production of primary dark matter particles have started 43 billion years later. It is shown that characteristic distance between particles is 30 times smaller than the thermal de Brogle wavelength, so that quantum effects, including formation of the Bose-Einstein condensate, can dominate. &quot;Ordinary&quot; matter was synthesized from dark matter in galaxies. Supplementary exact solutions are obtained for various ranges of parameters. From the theory we get an interface between dark and ordinary matter (IDOM), which very likely exist not only in cosmos, but everywhere, including our body and our brain. Key words: cosmology; age of the universe; dark matter; interface between dark and ordinary matter.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper I look at MOND from the perspective of my elementary particle Dark matter halo hypothesis. First I repeat the core elements of my model, in order for the paper to be self contained. Then I show how the energy equation for the rotation curve with an extra constant term can give the natural but deceptive impression that Newton's Laws have to be corrected for the ultra low regime, if this energy perspective is missing. Special attention is given to the virtual aspect of the acceleration, virtual as in not caused by Newton's force of gravity, due to a constant kinetic energy caused by the Dark Matter halo at large distances. The rotation curve equations are discussed and the one from my model is given. Conclusions are drawn from the $\Lambda$CDM core-cusp problem in relation to this new perspective on MOND as hiding a Dark Matter model perspective. My model might well be the bridge between MOND at the galactic scale and $\Lambda$CDM at the cosmic level.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/e_p_j_de_haas">E.P.J. de Haas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper I introduce a new Dark matter hypothesis. I assume that every elementary particle has a Dark Matter halo. Given a rest mass m_0 at r=0, it will have an additional spherical Dark Matter halo containing an extra mass in the sphere with radius r as m_DM = (r/R_DM)m_0 with the constant Dark Matter radius R_DM having a measured value somewhere in between 10 kpc and 20 kpc, so approximately once or twice the radius of an average luminous galaxy. The total rest mass of an elementary particle contained within a sphere with radius r will then be given by m = m_0 + (r/R_DM)m_0. The correlated mass density is \rho_DM = m_0/(4 pi r^2 R_DM). The new Newtonian gravitational energy will be U_g = - GM_0 m_0/r - G M_0 m_0/R_DM resulting in an unchanged Newtonian force of gravity but with a correct galaxy velocity rotation curve, due to the still applicable virial energy theorem. The axiom is theory of gravity neutral because it is a statement about mass and mass density distribution only. But it implies that WIMP's and the like aren't necessary to explain Dark Matter; my proposal isn't WIMP neutral. Beyond the scale of galaxy clusters the model becomes problematic due to an extra halo halo interaction term becoming active at that scale.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A quantum gravity experiment was reported in Cahill, Progress in Physics 2015, v.11(4), 317-320, with the data confirming the generalisation of the Schrodinger equation to include the interaction of the wave function with dynamical space. Dynamical space, via this interaction process, raises and lowers the energy of the electron wave function, which is detected by observing consequent variations in the electron quantum barrier tunnelling rate in reverse-biased Zener diodes. This process has previously been reported and enabled the measurement of the speed of the dynamical space flow, which is consistent with numerous other detection experiments. However Vrba, Progress in Physics, 2015, v.11(4), 330, has suggested the various experimental results may have been caused by magnetic field effects, but without any experimental evidence. Here we show experimentally that there is no such magnetic field effect in the Zener Diode Dynamical Space Quantum Detectors.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In 1907 Einstein used special relativity to prove that vacuum permittivity is a function of gravity by assuming that acceleration and gravity are equivalent. Vacuum permittivity is the scalar in Maxwell's equations that determines the speed of light and the strength of electrical fields. Predictably, vacuum permittivity also changes with spacetime curvature in general relativity. When spacetime curvature changes, the wavelengths of both photons and atomic emissions shift. In Friedmann geometry, curvature changes in time. A photon today has a different wavelength than it did yesterday. Yesterday, an atom emitted a photon with a different wavelength than it emits today. Considered together, the evolution of atoms and photons reverse the interpretation of Hubble redshift. Hubble redshift implies that the Friedmann universe is closed and collapsing. During collapse, both atomic emissions and photons blueshift. Atomic emissions blueshift about twice as much as photons blueshift. This means that blueshifted photons seen in a telescope today are redder than blueshifted reference photons emitted by atoms today. With this insight, supernovae redshift observations are fit simply using the physics of Maxwell, Einstein, Bohr, and Friedmann from the 1920's. There is no need to postulate dark energy. Supernovae redshift data imply that the universe is very nearly flat and will collapse in about 9.6 billion years. High-z redshift observations up to 11.9 suggest that the universe is at least 2000 billion years old. This is more than a hundred times greater than a typical star's lifetime. It is probable that most dark matter is the residue of stellar evolution. The changes in atoms and photons derived here confirm Schr&#246;dinger's 1939 proof that quantum wave functions expand and contract proportionally to the radius of a closed Friedmann universe.</div>

<div class='title'>Wep and SR on a Global Free Fall Grid Used to Derive Gravitational Relativistic Corrections to GPS/GNSS Clocks on the Level of the Training of Standard GPS/GNSS Engineers</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/e_p_j_de_haas">E.P.J. de Haas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Using frequency gauged clocks on a free fall grid we look at gravitational phenomena as they appear for observers on a stationary grid in a central field of gravity. With an approach based on Special Relativity, the Weak Equivalence Principle and Newton's gravitational potential we derive first order correct expressions for the gravitational red shift of stationary clocks and of satellites. We also derive a second order correction of a satellite's clock frequency, related to the geodetic precession. In the derivation of the apparent velocity of light in a field of gravity, a Lorentz symmetry breaking occurred. The derived changed radial velocity of light is at the basis of the Shapiro delay and the gravitational index of refraction, so phenomena connected to the curvature of the metric. The advantage of the free fall grid SR-WEP approach is that it is less advanced and thus far less complicated as compared to the GR approach, but still accurate enough for all GPS purposes for the next few decades. Also important: our approach is never in conflict with GR because we do not introduce additional axioms to the ones already in use in GR. We only use less axioms. For GPS engineers, our approach will give a deeper insight into problems concerning clock synchronization in a grid around the earth, without using the complex mathematics needed in GR. The free fall grid SR-WEP approach can be taught to GPS engineers in an achievable and economically affordable time. It will considerably reduce the communication gap between those engineers and the GR experts.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Using a phenomenological model in the ultra-relativistic limits we suggest that elementary particles including photons transforms in to micro black holes subjected to the following critical conditions:(i) When the de Broglie wavelength of elementary particles becomes equal to its Schwarzschild radius its energy reaches an upper limit (Em) given by the relation: Em= hc3/2Gm where m is the rest mass of the elementary particle (ii) Particle black holes will have a mass equal to the limiting relativistic mass of the elementary particles and Schwarzschild radius equal to Compton wavelength of these particles. Lorentz invariance of the Compton wavelength of elementary particles in the trans Planckian scales is suggested from this result. Photon black holes are found to be similar to massive elementary particles resembling the Planck particles discussed in cosmology. We find that the known elementary particle physical properties may be a window to the early universe since it provides clues about density distribution and nature of primordial black holes formed during the post Planck era after the Big Bang</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/pavel_voracek">Pavel Vor&#225;&#269;ek</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Initially it is proposed to interpret the fact that the delay of gravitational interaction in a binary system causes the emanation of gravitational waves, as a generalization of the Newtonian Principle of action and reaction. Then, the impact of such a concept is shown for a situation with mutual and simultaneously acting electromagnetic and inertia force, as well as consequences for a possible validity of the Mach principle. Further, the same phenomenon of retardation of the physical interactions is applied on the mechanistic Bohr model of the hydrogen atom together with the Indeterminacy principle, which results in a realistically adequate quantum description of the atom involving the pertinent de Broglie wave. Finally, the physical conclusions made before are discussed from a philosophical point of view; a new `para-deterministic' concept is presented being an alternative to both the deterministic and holistic views of our world.</div>

<div class='title'>Quantum Gravity Experiments</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/reginald_t_cahill">Reginald T Cahill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A new quantum gravity experiment is reported with the data confirming the generalisation of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation to include the interaction of the wave function with dynamical space. Dynamical space turbulence, via this interaction process, raises and lowers the energy of the electron wave function, which is detected by observing consequent variations in the electron quantum barrier tunnelling rate in reverse-biased Zener diodes. This process has previously been reported and enabled the measurement of the speed of the dynamical space flow, which is consistent with numerous other detection experiments. The interaction process is dependent on the angle between the dynamical space flow velocity and the direction of the electron flow in the diode, and this dependence is experimentally demonstrated. This interaction process explains gravity as an emergent quantum process, so unifying quantum phenomena and gravity. Gravitational Waves are easily detected.</div>

<div class='title'>The Analysis of Gianluca Perniciano Applied to the Natario Warp Drive Spacetime in Both the Original and Parallel $3+1$ $adm$ Formalisms:</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However the major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy density able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!!. With the correct form of the shape function the Natario warp drive can overcome this obstacle at least in theory.Other drawbacks that affects the warp drive geometry are the collisions with hazardous interstellar matter(asteroids,comets,interstellar dust etc)that will unavoidably occurs when a ship travels at superluminal speeds and the problem of the Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime).The geometrical features of the Natario warp drive are the required ones to overcome these obstacles also at least in theory.Recently Gianluca Perniciano a physicist from Italy appeared with a very interesting idea for the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime:he introduced in the Alcubierre equations a coefficient which is $1$ inside and outside the warp bubble but possesses large values in the Alcubierre warped region thereby reducing effectively the negative energy density requirements making the warp drive more &quot;affordable&quot; even at $200$ times light speed.In this work we reproduce the Perniciano analysis for the Natario warp drive spacetime in both the original and parallel $ADM$ formalisms.</div>

<div class='title'>Inflation sans Singularity in &quot;Standard&quot; Transformed FLRW</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The calculations of Oppenheimer and Snyder showed that quasi-Newtonian cycloidal metric and energy density singularities in the behavior of an initially stationary uniform dust ball in &quot;comoving&quot; coordinates fail to carry over to &quot;standard&quot; coordinates, where that contracting dust ball at no finite time attains a radius (quite) as small as its Schwarzschild radius. This physical behavior disparity reflects the singular nature of the &quot;comoving&quot; to &quot;standard&quot; transformation, whose cause is that &quot;comoving time&quot; requires the clocks of an infinite number of different observers, making that &quot;time&quot; inherently physically unobservable. Notwithstanding the warning implicit in the Oppenheimer-Snyder example, checking other &quot;comoving&quot; dust ball results by transforming them to physically reliable coordinates is seldom emulated. We here consider the analytically simplest case of a dust ball whose energy density always decreases; its &quot;comoving&quot; result has a well known singularity at a sufficiently early time. But after transformation to &quot;standard&quot; coordinates, that singularity no longer occurs at any finite time, nor is this expanding dust ball at any finite time (quite) as small as its Schwarzschild radius. But this dust ball's expansion rate peaks at a substantial fraction of the speed of light when its radius equals a few times the Schwarzchild value, and the &quot;standard&quot; time when this inflationary expansion peak occurs is roughly equal to the &quot;comoving&quot; time of the &quot;occurrence&quot; of the unphysical &quot;comoving&quot; singularity.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jeffrey_p_baugher">Jeffrey P Baugher</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Parallel line segments are the basic graphical foundation for geometrical field theories such as General Relativity. Although the concept of parallel and curved lines have been well researched for over a century as a description of gravity, certain controversial issues have persisted, namely point singularities (Black Holes) and the physical interpretation of a scalar multiple of the metric, commonly known as a Cosmological Constant. We introduce a graphical and notational analysis system which we will refer to as Integral Geometry. Through variational analysis of perpendicular line segments we derive equations that ultimately result from the changes in the area bounded by them. Based upon changing area bounded by relative and absolute line segments we attempt to prove the following hypothesis: General Relativity cannot be derived from Integral Geometry. We submit that examination of the notational differences between GR and IG in order to accept the hypothesis could lead to evidence that the inability to merge General Relativity and Quantum Physics may be due to notational and conceptual flaws concerning area inherent in the equations describing them.</div>

<div class='title'>Galactic Rotational Velocities Explained by Relativistically Stable Orbits that Spiral Outward at Increasing Distance as Predicted by Explanation for Gravity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/william_e_rush">William E. Rush</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is proposed that the strong force is the force of space. Development of this concept leads to the prediction that the mass of all matter increases as the universe expands. This mass (energy) increase is absorbed from space and leads to the force of gravity. The rate of mass increase necessary to bring about the known force of gravity is calculated. A relationship between matter mass increase and matter length increase is developed and then used to calculate the rate of increase of matter length. This same rate of increase in length applies to all other lengths and orbits including galactic orbital distance. This fractional expansion rate is determined to be Gm/c(r)^2 where m and r are mass and radius of some smallest particle of definable dimensions. If m and r of a proton is chosen, this equation predicts that gravitational orbits double in length approximately every 45-85 million years. Orbits within galaxies, with orbital periods of hundreds of millions of years, will therefore be outward spirals as measured by time zero length, though orbital distances will always be measured as unchanging. Higher orbital speeds are required to maintain these spiral orbits than the orbital speeds required to maintain circular orbits at the same orbital radii. Calculations within show that for a typical galaxy (M31) at typical galactic distances of about 15 - 30 kpc, the galactic orbits increase in radius, or can be considered to ``accelerate&quot; outward, at approximately the same acceleration rate as the gravitational acceleration rate required to hold stars in a circular orbit at the observed rotational velocity. These equivalent accelerations are near the MOND critical value of 10^-10 m/sec^2. This may explain the anomaly of galactic rotational velocities without dark matter. The concepts proposed here require that the fundamental constants change with the expanding universe; however, if the principle of relativity (not the theory) is embraced, then this requires that these physical and fundamental constants are linked such that they appear to remain unchanged.</div>

<div class='title'>Quantum Time is the Time it Takes for an Elementary Particle to Absorb a Quantum of Energy</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_tassano">James A. Tassano</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper is a continuation of a series of papers on the universe as the surface volume of a four dimensional, expanding hyperverse. We argue that the whole universe is undergoing a geometric mean expansion, and is larger than the observable hyperverse by a factor of (R_sub_H / 2 Planck lengths)^4 , and its radius is larger by a factor of (R_sub_H / 2 Planck lengths)^4/3. The growth rate of the whole is actually accelerating, compared to the constant, 2c velocity we measure for the observable universe. We show that the ratio of the length of the small energy quantum (SEQ), to the small radius quantum (SRQ), values discussed at length in earlier hyperverse papers, is increasing at the same rate as the whole radius is increasing. We also show that, depending on the type of particle, the amount of time it takes for a particle to travel the distance of one SEQ length, approximately 10^-23 seconds, matches the time it takes for the particle to absorb one SEQ of energy. The quantum of time is the time it takes for an elementary particle to absorb one SEQ quantum of energy. The unit of quantum time is not a constant, but increases in duration at the same rate as the increase in the velocity of the whole hyperverse, canceling it, giving us the constant, 2c radial expansion rate. Significantly, our equation for the quantum of time, derived from the hyperverse model, using only the values of c, G, h-bar and the radius of the observable hyperverse, matches the quantized time interval calculated for the electron by Piero Caldirola, using classical electron theory. His 'chronon', and our quantum absorption time, are identical values. Equating the two quantum time equations produces the correct equation of electric charge, further supporting the validity of the hyperverse model and the unit of quantum time. We continue by showing that the relation between particle mass and quantum absorption time is governed by the time-energy uncertainty relationship, allowing easy calculation of the quantum time values for all elementary particles, and supporting the concept of the geometric mean expansion of space.</div>

Then it can be concluded that the resulting space-dimensionality three, being equal to what we consider to be the naturally optimal dimensionality of the real space, implies the existence of a certain deviation from this optimal value on the cosmological scale-level (&lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; a deviation from the space-'Euclidicity' there), since a fourth space-dimension is explicitely or implicitely necessary (depending only on what form of the spacetime-metric one has used) in order to allow the Universe to be closed. As a consequence, the bent space (considered to be the component of the curved spacetime), together with the real cosmic stratum there, struggles to arrive to the state with the optimal dimensionality, &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, it struggles to expand, while the 'pseudo- pressure' is the carrier of the 'dimensionally-elastic' energy, which appears as the &lt;i&gt;dark energy&lt;/i&gt; (on the global cosmological scale) and the &lt;i&gt;dark matter&lt;/i&gt; (on the scale-level of cosmic inhomogenities).

But, is it possible to detect the pressure of the vacuum as per the geometry of the space around the local bodies? The gravitational mass of bodies placed in confined volume, is less than the sum of the gravitational masses of these bodies, dispersed over infinite distance. It interprets into the transfer of energy to the vacuum, which becomes apparent from its deformation. We determine the gravitational impact of matter on the vacuum, equal in value and opposite in the sign of pressure, in case of weakly gravitating spherical bodies.

<div class='title'>On the Geometry of Space</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/frederik_vantomme">Frederik Vantomme</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>&lt;p&gt;I explore the possibility that black holes and Space could be the geometrically Compactified Transverse Slices (&quot;CTS&quot;s) of their higher (+1) dimensional space. My hypothesis is that we might live somewhere in between partially compressed regions of space, namely 4d&lt;sub&gt;L+R&lt;/sub&gt; hyperspace compactified to its 3d transverse slice, and fully compressed dark regions, i.e. black holes, still containing all &lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;d432-1-234d&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; dimensional fields. This places the DGP, ADD, Kaluza-Klein, Randall-Sundrum, Holographic and Vanishing Dimensions theories in a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first postulate that a black hole could be the result of the compactification (fibration) of a 3d burned up S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; star to its 2d transverse slice; the 2d dimensional discus itself further spiralling down into a bundle of one-dimensional fibres.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, Space could be the compactified transverse slice (fibration) of its higher 4d&lt;sub&gt;L+R&lt;/sub&gt; S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hyper-sphere to its 3d transverse slice, the latter adopting the topology of a closed and flat left+right handed trefoil knot. By further extending these two ideas, we might consider that the Universe in its initial state was a &quot;Matroska&quot; 4d&lt;sub&gt;L+R&lt;/sub&gt; hyperspace compactified, in cascading order, to a bundle of one-dimensional fibres. The Big Bang could be an explosion from within that broke the cascadingly compressed Universe open.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/reginald_t_cahill">Reginald T Cahill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Experiments have repeatedly revealed the existence of a dynamical structured fractal 3-space, with a speed relative to the Earth of some 500km/s from a southerly direction. Experiments have ranged from optical light speed anisotropy interferometers to zener diode quantum detectors. This dynamical space has been missing from theories from the beginning of physics. This dynamical space generates a growing universe, and gravity when included in a generalised Schrodinger equation, and light bending when included in generalised Maxwell equations. Here we review ongoing attempts to construct a deeper theory of the dynamical space starting from a stochastic pattern generating model that appears to result in 3-dimensional geometrical elements, &#8220;gebits&#8221;, and accompanying quantum behaviour. The essential concept is that reality is a process, and geometrical models for space and time are inadequate.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/reginald_t_cahill">Reginald T cahill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The anisotropy of the velocity of EM radiation has been repeatedly detected, including the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887, using a variety of techniques. The experiments reveal the existence of a dynamical space that has a velocity of some 500km/s from a southerly direction. These consistent experiments contradict the assumptions of Special Relativity, but are consistent with the assumptions of neo-Lorentz Relativity. The existence of the dynamical space has been missed by physics since its beginnings. Novel and checkable phenomena then follow from including this space in Quantum Theory, EM Theory, Cosmology, etc, including the derivation of a more general theory of gravity as a quantum wave refraction effect. The corrected Schrodinger equation has resulted in a very simple and robust quantum detector, which easily measures the speed and direction of the dynamical space. This report reviews the key experimental evidence.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/reginald_t_cahill">Reginald T Cahill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 2014 Jiapei Dai reported evidence of anisotropic Brownian motion of a toluidine blue colloid solution in water. In 2015 Felix Scholkmann analysed the Dai data and detected a sidereal time dependence, indicative of a process driving the preferred Brownian motion diusion direction to a star-based preferred direction. Here we further analyse the Dai data and extract the RA and Dec of that preferred direction, and relate the data to previous determinations from NASA Spacecraft Earth-flyby Doppler shift data, and other determinations. It is shown that the anisotropic Brownian motion is an anisotropic &#8220;heating&#8221; generated by 3-space fluctuations: gravitational waves, an eect previously detected in correlations between ocean temperature fluctuations and solar flare counts, with the latter being shown to be a proxy for 3-space fluctuations. The dynamical 3- space does not have a measure of energy content, but can generate energy in matter systems, which amounts to a violation of the 1st Law of Thermodynamics.</div>

<div class='title'>Two New Warp Drive Equations Based on Parallel $3+1$ Adm Formalisms in Contravariant and Covariant Forms Applied to the Natario Spacetime Geometry</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However the major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy density able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!!. With the correct form of the shape function the Natario warp drive can overcome this obstacle at least in theory.Other drawbacks that affects the warp drive geometry are the collisions with hazardous interstellar matter(asteroids,comets,interstellar dust etc)that will unavoidably occurs when a ship travels at superluminal speeds and the problem of the Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime).The geometrical features of the Natario warp drive are the required ones to overcome these obstacles also at least in theory. Some years ago starting from $2012$ to $2014$ a set of works appeared in the current scientific literature covering the Natario warp drive with an equation intended to be the original Natario equation however this equation do not obeys the original $3+1$ Arnowitt-Dresner-Misner($ADM$) formalism and hence this equation cannot be regarded as the original Natario warp drive equation.However this new equation satisfies the Natario criteria for a warp drive spacetime and as a matter of fact this equation must be analyzed under a new and parallel contravariant $3+1$ $ADM$ formalism.In this work we introduce also a second new Natario equation but using a parallel covariant $3+1$ $ADM$ formalism. We compare both the original and parallel $3+1$ $ADM$ formalisms wether in contravariant or covariant form using the approach of Misner-Thorne-Wheeler($MTW$) and Alcubierre and while in the $3+1$ spacetime the parallel equations differs radically from the original one when we reduce the equations to a $1+1$ spacetime all the equations becomes equivalent.We discuss the possibilities in General Relativity for these new equations.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In our framework for 'realistic non-singular cosmology' we consider a more radical situation where the present photonic temperature of the universe is higher (for instance ~16 K) than that suggested by the microwave background. This leads to a minimal scale of ~0.08, and a maximum temperature of ~192 K, for an oscillating cosmology whose main protagonists are whole galaxies rather that stars, with an age of the current expansion of ~8.9 Gyr. We show that this scheme is quite compatible with the supernovae data for magnitudes and redshifts, provided that the Hubble fraction is ~0.55.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Galileo proposed a simple gravity experiment that has yet to be performed. Suppose we drop a test mass into a hole through the center of a larger source mass. What happens? Using a modified Cavendish balance or an orbiting satellite, modern technology could have revealed the answer decades ago. General Relativity is widely regarded as being supported by empirical evidence throughout its accessible range. Not commonly realized is that, with regard to gravity-induced motion, this evidence excludes the interior regions of material bodies over this whole range. If only to fill this huge gap in our empirical knowledge of gravity, Galileo&#8217;s experiment ought to be performed without further delay.</div>

<div class='title'>Space Generation Model of Gravity, Cosmic Numbers, and Dark Energy</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_benish">Richard Benish</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This is an updated and augmented version of the previously published paper, Space Generation Model of Gravitation and the Large Numbers Coincidences. The basis of the gravity model is that motion sensing devices&#8212;most notably accelerometers and clocks&#8212;consistently tell the truth about their state of motion. When the devices are attached to a uniformly rotating body this is undoubtedly true. Uniform rotation is sometimes referred to as an example of stationary motion. It is proposed here, by analogy, that gravitation is also an example of stationary motion. Einstein used the rotation analogy to deduce spacetime curvature. Similar logic suggests that in both cases the effects of curvature are caused by motion. A key distinction is that, unlike rotation, gravitational motion is not motion through space, but rather motion of space. Extending the analogy further, gravitation is conceived as a process involving movement into a fourth space dimension. Space and matter are dynamic, continuous extensions of each other, which implies that the average cosmic density is a universal constant. Assuming this to be the case leads to a cosmological model according to which ratios such as the gravitational to electrostatic force, electron mass to proton mass, Bohr radius to cosmic radius, and constants such as the fine structure constant, Hubble constant, the saturation density of nuclear matter and the energy density of the cosmic background radiation are all very simply related to one another. Measured values of these numbers are discussed in suffcient detail to facilitate judging whether or not the found and predicted relationships are due to chance. The notorious &quot;cosmological constant&quot; (dark energy) problem is also addressed in light of the new gravity model. Finally, it is emphasized that the model lends itself to a relatively easy laboratory test.</div>

This paper is interesting and important because it touches the weakest nerve of General Relativity by asking &#8220;how mass curves spacetime&#8221;? Moreover, this article is supported by several mathematics demonstrations such as a new version of the Newton Law, a new version of the Schwarzschild Metric, and a 4D rewriting of the Energy-Momentum Tensor and Einstein Constant.</div>

The conclusion being that the Universe has five dimensions but that we only perceive four dimensions.

Under this condition, loses its meaning and the concept of dark energy, and the imaginary phenomenon of divergence of the objects of the Universe, which is registered as a red shift based on the Doppler effect due to the increase of the linear velocity of these objects with increasing distances from the observer in a rotating spherical space of the Universe. The kinetic energy of the rotating Universe may be the source of dark matter. The energy of the accelerated expansion of the Universe by the pressure of the vacuum does not depend on the absolute value of the vacuum pressure, but it depends on the relative value. Relative value vacuum pressure is equal to the difference between the values of vacuum pressure at the boundary of the Universe to expand and beyond. Since this difference is equal to zero, then does not exist of dark energy.</div>

We also derive first order correct expressions for the geodetic precession, the Shapiro delay basis and the gravitational index of refraction, so phenomena connected to the curvature of the metric.

But researcher A with rocket has full control of the situation, he can come close to Black Hole, almost to contact and observe everything. Therefore, the distance between A and B may be zero. It does not depend on when in the past the body B was shut into a black hole. Therefore, the black hole horizon has one big collision of bodies.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/s_a_podosenov">S.A. Podosenov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>An exact solution for the field of a charge in a uniformly accelerated noninertial frame of reference (NFR) alongside the &quot;Equivalent Situation Postulate&quot;allows one to find space-time structure as well as fields from arbitrarily shaped charged conductors, without using Einstein&#8217;s equations. In particular, the space-time metric over a charged plane can be related to the metric being obtained from an exact solution to Einstein- Maxwell&#8217;s equations. This solution describes an equilibrium of charged dust in parallel electric and gravitational fields. The field and metric outside a conducting ball have been found. The method proposed eliminates divergence of the proper energy and makes classical electrodynamics consistent at any sufficiently small distances. An experiment is proposed to verify the approach suggested.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/pierre_real_gosselin">Pierre R&#233;al Gosselin</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We lay down the fundamental hypothesis that any electromagnetic radiation transforms progressively, evolving towards and finally reaching after an appropriate distance the value of the cosmic microwave background radiation, a 1,873 mm wavelength. This way we explain the cosmic redshift Z of far away Galaxies using only Maxwell&#8217;s equations and the energy quantum principle of the photons. Hubble&#8217;s law sprouts out naturally as the consequence of this transformation. According to this hypothesis we compute the constant Ho (84,3 Km/s/Mpc) using data from the Pioneer satellite and doing so deciphering the enigm of its anomalous behaviour. This hypothesis is confirmed by solving some cases that are still enigmatic for the standard cosmology. We review the distance modulus formula and comment on the limits of cosmological observations.</div>

However numerous other experiments have shown that it is only neo-Lorentz Relativity that accounts for all data, and all detect a 3-space speed $V\approx 470$km/s essentially from the south.

<div class='title'>The Analysis of Harold Puthoff Applied to the Natario Warp Drive Spacetime: Can the Spacetime Metric Engineering be Really Used for Superluminal Interstellar Spaceflight??}</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However the major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy density able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!!. With the correct form of the shape function the Natario warp drive can overcome this obstacle at least in theory.Other drawbacks that affects the warp drive geometry are the collisions with hazardous interstellar matter(asteroids,comets,interstellar dust etc)that will unavoidably occurs when a ship travels at superluminal speeds and the problem of the Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime).The geometrical features of the Natario warp drive are the required ones to overcome these obstacles also at least in theory. \newline Some years ago the American physicist Harold Puthoff published a very interesting work in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society.He theorized about the possibility of the modification of the spacetime geometry by arbitrary advanced civilizations able to generate the so-called metric engineering and such a modification would be supposed to &quot;allow&quot; the propulsion of spaceships at superluminal velocities.However Puthoff used only diagonalized metrics for his analysis and he even quotes the Schwarzschild metric.In this work we reproduce the Puthoff analysis for the Natario warp drive spacetime and due to the fact that the Natario warp drive is a non-diagonalized metric due to the presence of both the shift and Natario vectors our results are different than the ones obtained by Puthoff.However his idea of a spacetime metric engineering able to distort the spacetime geometry &quot;allowing&quot; superluminal interstellar spaceflight is perfectly possible.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/reginald_t_cahill">Reginald T Cahill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Space speed fluctuations, which have a 1/f spectrum, are shown to be the cause of solar flares. The direction and magnitude of the space flow has been detected from numerous different experimental techniques, and is close to the normal to the plane of the ecliptic. Zener diode data shows that the fluctuations in the space speed closely match the Sun Solar Cycle 23 flare count, and reveal that major solar flares follow major space speed fluctuations by some 6 days. This implies that a warning period of some 5 days in predicting major solar flares is possible using such detectors. This has significant consequences in being able to protect various spacecraft and Earth located electrical systems from the subsequent arrival of ejected plasma from a solar flare. These space speed fluctuations are the actual gravitational waves, and have a significant magnitude. This discovery is a significant application of the dynamical space phenomenon and theory. We also show that space flow turbulence impacts on the Earth's climate, as such turbulence can input energy into systems, which is the basis of the Zener Diode Quantum Detector. Large scale space fluctuations impact on both the sun and the Earth, and as well explain temperature correlations with solar activity, but that the Earth temperatures are not caused by such solar activity. This implies that the Earth climate debate has been missing a key physical process. Observed diminishing gravitational waves imply a cooling epoch for the Earth for the next 30 years.</div>

<div class='abstract'>BICEP2 team has announced a detection of gravitational waves via the effects of gravitational waves on the spectrum on polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB). The findings - if true - have powerful implications for cosmological models. In this article the findings are discussed in the framework of TGD based cosmology in which the flatness of 3-space is interpreted in terms of quantum criticality rather than inflation. The key role is played by gradually thickening cosmic strings carrying magnetic monopole flux, dark energy as magnetic energy and dark matter as large h&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; phases at cosmic strings. Very thin cosmic strings dominate the cosmology before the emergence of space-time as we know it and quantum criticality is associated with the phase transition between these two phases. Later cosmic strings serve as seeds of various cosmological structures by decaying partially to ordinary matter somewhat like inflaton fields in inflationary cosmology. Cosmic strings also explain the presence of magnetic fields in cosmos difficult to understand in standard approch. The crucial point is that - in contrast to ordinary magnetic fields - monopole fluxes do not require for their creation any currents coherent in long scales.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Eintein&#8217;s General Relativity does not explain recent enigmas of astrophysics such as dark energy or accelerating universe.

Solving these inconsistencies and bringing closer the EFE to the Higgs mechanism fully explains the mass and gravity phenomena. The main interest of this study is to propose a formula of mass in 4D, m=f(x,y,z,t), that solves several basic enigmas fully demonstrated with mathematics but still not explained with logic and good sense, such as &#8220;How spacetime can be curved by mass?&#8221;, or &#8216;What is the nature of the gravitational force?&#8221;, or &#8220;What is the mechanism of conversion of mass into energy (E =mc2)?&#8221;.

<div class='abstract'>Oppenheimer and Snyder treated in &quot;comoving coordinates&quot; a finite-radius ball of self-gravitationally contracting dust whose energy density is initially static; this is incisively dealt with by use of Tolman's rarely-cited closed-form &quot;comoving&quot; metric solutions for all spherically-symmetric nonuniform dust distributions. Unaware of Tolman's general solutions, Oppenheimer and Snyder assumed that the uniform space-filling dust solution applies without modification to the interior of their dust ball, which is validated by Tolman's solutions. We also find that all nonuniform dust solutions which adhere to the Oppenheimer-Snyder initial conditions have a time-cycloid character that strikingly parallels Newtonian particle gravitational infall, and as well renders those solutions periodically singular. The highly intricate, and thus easily misapprehended, singular transformation of the Oppenheimer-Snyder dust-ball solution from &quot;comoving&quot; to &quot;standard&quot; coordinates is re-derived in detail; it reveals the completely nonsingular nature of the dust-ball metric in &quot;standard&quot; coordinates. Thus the periodically-singular quasi-Newtonian character of the &quot;comoving&quot; dust-ball metric is an artifact of the perceptibly unphysical &quot;synthetic&quot; nature of &quot;comoving coordinates&quot;, whose definition requires the clocks of an infinite number of observers.</div>

<div class='abstract'>According to general relativity the geometry of space depends on the distribution of matter or energy fields. The relation between the locally defined geometry parameters and the volume elements depends on curvature. Thus integration of local properties like energy density, defined in the Euclidean tangent space, does not lead to correct integral data like total energy. To obtain integral conservation, a correction term must be added to account for the curvature of space. This correction term is the equivalent of potential energy in Newtonian gravitation. With this correction the formation of singularities by gravitational collapse does no longer occur and the so called dark energy finds its natural explanation as potential energy of matter itself.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Special Theory of Relativity does not explain the cosmic muon decay phenomenon; it is not evidence of time dilation. The &#8220;dilated time&#8221; of special relativity has no physical interpretation as time as interpreted in physics; therefore, the extended lifetime of the muon, arrived at through the used of time dilation,cannot be used in the simple formula : distance = speed x time. So far, no one seems to have pointed to this simple fact. An invalid argument has been repeated and propagated for decades that purportedly resolves the cosmic muon decay phenomenon. Furthermore, the best experiment by CERN [3] measured the average lifetime of muon as 64.368(29) &#956;s, (&#947; = 29.33, v = 0.9994 c). The now accepted mean proper lifetime for &#956; &#8722; = 2.19489(10) &#956;s is a value computed from the relativistic time dilation formula using the figure of 64.368(29) &#956;s assuming the validity of Special Relativity Theory; it is not an empirical value from experiments.</div>

Since the cosmological expansion creates the space, the cosmological vacuum is considered as a very hegemonic entity which is the locus where all the objects create the events. Certainly, N units of masses in conjunct are required to produce an equilibrium between the gravitational phenomena of the matter in bulk and each coulombic interaction between protons and electrons within the nuclear and atomic contour in all astrophysical (e.g. stars) or cosmological entities (e.g. galaxies).

<div class='title'>A Simple Theory of Gravity Based on Mach's Principle</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/arindam_sinha">Arindam Sinha</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A simple and intuitive alternative theory of gravity based on Mach's Principle is proposed. At any location, total gravitational potential from the Universe's matter distribution is c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This Universal background potential constitutes unit rest energy of matter and provides its unit mass, which is the essence behind E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The background gravity creates a local sidereal inertial frame at every location. A velocity increases gravitational potential through net blue-shift of Universe's background gravity, causing kinematic time dilation, which is a form of gravitational time dilation. Matter and energy follow different rules of motion, as matter does not undergo Shapiro delay. As a consequence, speed of matter may exceed the speed of light. The theory is consistent with existing relativity experiments, and is falsifiable based on experiments whose predictions differ from General Relativity. The theory also explains why all the ICARUS and corrected OPERA experiments still show mean neutrino velocities slightly above speed of light (early arrival of neutrinos by 0.1-6.5ns), even after correcting the issues that had led to the original OPERA experiments to erroneously report faster than light neutrinos (early arrival by ~60ns).</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper shown; on the one hand, as the tensor-scalar polarization modes B ratio, it is derived from the initial properties of the vacuum due to the unification of gravitation and electromagnetism. This ratio suggest that it is 2/Pi ^ 2 (0.20262423673), as an upper bound. Secondly; demonstrates that it is not necessary to introduce any inflaton scalar field or similar ( ad-hoc fields ); If on the other hand, is the same structure of the vacuum and the quantization of gravity which perfectly explains this initial exponential expansion of the universe. In some respects exponential vacuum emptying has certain similarities with the emission of radiation of a black hole. This quantization of gravity and its unification with electromagnetic field, shown in previous work; It allows deriving complete accurately the exponential factor of inflation; and therefore calculate accurately the Hubble constant, mass of the universe, matter density, the value of the vacuum energy density, the GUT mass scale ( bosons X,Y ), the gravitino mass and more. The method of quantize gravity used in this work; It is based on dimensionless constants that must be enforced in accordance with general relativity. We demonstrate the existence of quantum wormholes as the basic units of space-time energy, as an inseparable system.These quantum wormholes explain the instantaneous speed of propagation of entangled particles. Or what is the same: an infinite speed, with the condition of zero net energy. Another consequence of the dimensionless quantization of gravity; is the existence of a constant gravitational acceleration that permeates all space. Its nature is quantum mechanical, and inseparable from the Hubble constant. This work is not mere speculation; since applying this vacuum gravitational acceleration; first allows us to explain and accurately calculate the anomaly of the orbital eccentricity of the Moon. This anomaly was detected and accurately measured with the laser ranging experiment. This same constant acceleration in vacuum (in all coordinate of space), which interacts with the masses; explains the almost constant rotation curves of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Therefore there is no dark matter. Current interpretation of quantum mechanics is completely erroneous. We explain that; as the de Broglie&#8211;Bohm theory, also known as the pilot-wave theory; is a much more realistic and correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. The current assumption that there is reality no defined; until the act of observation does not occur; is an aberrant, illogical assertion false and derived from the obsolete current interpretation of quantum mechanics. The age of the universe derived from the Hubble constant is a wrong estimate; due to absolute ignorance of the true nature of this constant and its physical implications. The universe acquired its current size in the very short period of time, a unit of Planck time. We understand that this work is dense and completely revolutionary consequences. Experiments reflection of lasers; type of the laser ranging experiment; undoubtedly will confirm one of the main results: the existence of an intrinsic acceleration of vacuum of gravitational quantum mechanical nature, which explains the rotation curves of galaxies and clusters of galaxies; and which thus makes unnecessary the existence of dark matter.</div>

<div class='title'>The Analysis of Lobo and Visser Applied to Both Natario and Casimir Warp Drives. Physical Reactions of Gravitational Repulsive Behavior Between the Positive Mass of the Spaceship and the Negative Mass of the Warp Bubble</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. The major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!! Although the energy conditions of General Relativity forbids the existence of negative energy the Casimir Effect first predicted by Casimir in $1948$ and verified experimentally by Lamoreaux in $1997$ allows sub-microscopical amounts of it.We introduce in this work a shape function that will low the negative energy density requirements in the Natario warp drive from $10^{48} \frac{Joules}{Meter^{3}}$ to $10^{-7} \frac{Joules}{Meter^{3}}$ a low and affordable level. However reducing the negative energy density requirements of the warp drive to arbitrary low levels works only for empty bubbles not for bubbles with real spaceships inside because the positive mass of the spaceship exerts over the negative mass of the bubble a gravitational repulsive force and a spaceship with a large positive mass inside a bubble of small negative mass destroys the bubble.According to Lobo and Visser we can reduce the negative energy density of the warp bubble only to the limit when the negative energy becomes a reasonable fraction of the positive mass/energy of the spaceship.and no less otherwise the bubble is destroyed.The analysis of Lobo and Visser must be taken in account when considering bubbles with real spaceships inside otherwise the warp drive may not work.We reproduce in this work the analysis of Lobo and Visser for the Natario and Casimir warp drives.The work of Lobo and Visser is the third most important work in warp drive science immediately after the works of Alcubierre and Natario and the Lobo-Visser paper must also be considered a seminal paper like the ones of both Alcubierre and Natario.</div>

<div class='title'>Gravity Experiment in Waiting</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_benish">Richard Benish</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 1632 Galileo proposed an extremely simple gravity experiment that has yet to be carried out. Its essence is to determine what happens when a test mass is dropped into a hole through the center of a larger source mass. It is a common problem in first year physics courses. Using a modified Cavendish balance or an orbiting satellite, with modern technology the experiment could have been done decades ago. In a seemingly unrelated context, many modern theories in physics have been criticized for their lack of connection with empirical evidence. One of the critics, Jim Baggott, has expounded on the problem in a book and more recently in an article, &lt;em&gt;The Evidence Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, posted to the weblog, &lt;em&gt;Scientia Salon&lt;/em&gt;. Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity is widely regarded as being supported by empirical evidence throughout its accessible range, from the scale of millimeters to Astronomical Units. Not commonly realized, however, is that, with regard to gravity-induced motion, the evidence excludes the &lt;em&gt;central&lt;/em&gt; regions of material bodies over this whole range. Specifically, the gravitational &lt;em&gt;interior&lt;/em&gt; solution has not been tested. It is thus argued that here too modern physics suffers an evidence crisis. The lack of evidence in this case pertains to what may be called the most ponderous half of the gravitational Universe, inside matter. This large gap in our empirical knowledge of gravity could be easily filled by conducting Galileo&#8217;s experiment. As conscientious scientists, it is argued, this is what we ought to do.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Weyl conformal tensor describes the distorting but volume-preserving tidal effects of gravitation on a material body. A rather complicated combination of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor, the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar, the Weyl tensor is used in the construction of a unique conformally-invariant Lagrangian. In 1938 Cornelius Lanczos discovered a clever simplification of the mathematics that eliminated the RC term, thus considerably reducing the complexity of the overall Lagrangian.

<div class='title'>Speed of Light and Rates of Clocks in the Space Generation Model of Gravitation, Part 1</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_benish">Richard Benish</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>General Relativity&#8217;s Schwarzschild solution describes a spherically symmetric gravitational field as an utterly static thing. The Space Generation Model (SGM) describes it as an absolutely moving thing. The SGM nevertheless agrees equally well with observations made in the fields of the Earth and Sun, because it predicts almost exactly the same spacetime curvature. This success of the SGM motivates deepening the context&#8212;especially with regard to the fundamental concepts of motion. The roots of Einstein&#8217;s relativity theories thus receive critical examination. A particularly illuminating and widely applicable example is that of uniform rotation, which was used to build General Relativity (GR). Comparing Einstein&#8217;s logic to that of the SGM, the most significant difference concerns the interpretation of the readings of accelerometers and the rates of clocks. Where Einstein infers relativity of motion and spacetime symmetry, it is argued to be more logical to infer absoluteness of motion and spacetime asymmetry. This approach leads to reassessments of the essential nature of matter, time, and the dimensionality of space, which lead in turn to some novel cosmological consequences. Special emphasis is given to the model&#8217;s deviations from standard predictions inside matter, which have never been tested, but could be tested by conducting a simple experiment.</div>

<div class='title'>Advanced Numerical Approaches in the Dynamics of Relativistic Flows</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/david_radice">David Radice</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Strong gravity and relativistic plasma flows are among the fundamental ingredients powering high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as short and long gamma ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae and relativistic outflows from black-hole accreting systems. General-relativistic hydrodynamics is also essential in modelling the merger of neutron stars binaries and black-hole neutron- star binaries that are among the best sources for future gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo or KAGRA. Over the past decade, the understanding of these phenomena has benefited significantly from the results obtained through non-linear numerical calculations. Key factors in this progress have been the switch to more advanced numerical schemes that are able to properly treat relativistic shock waves, and the progressive inclusion of more &#8220;physics&#8221;, such as magnetic fields or realistic equations of state. Following this trend, even better numerical tools and more accurate physical description will be be essential to understand these phenomena. This thesis aims at contributing to both of these aspects.</div>

<div class='title'>Reconciling Mach's Principle and General Relativity Into a Simple Alternative Theory of Gravity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/arindam_sinha">Arindam Sinha</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A theory of gravity reconciling Mach's Principle and General Relativity (GR) is proposed. At any location, total gravitational potential from the Universe's matter distribution is c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This Universal background potential constitutes unit rest energy of matter and provides its unit mass, which is the essence behind E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The background gravity creates a local sidereal inertial frame at every location. A velocity increases gravitational potential through net blue-shift of Universe's background gravity, causing kinematic time dilation, which is a form of gravitational time dilation. Matter and energy follow different rules of motion, and speed of matter may exceed the speed of light. The theory is consistent with existing relativity experiments, and is falsifiable based on experiments whose predictions differ from GR. The theory also explains why all the ICARUS and corrected OPERA experiments still show mean neutrino velocities slightly above speed of light (early arrival of neutrinos by 0.1-6.5ns), even after correcting the issues that had led to the original OPERA experiments to erroneously report faster than light neutrinos (early arrival by ~60ns).</div>

<div class='abstract'>We propose a modification of Einstein-Cartan gravity equations. The modified cosmology departs from the standard model of cosmology for small Hubble parameter. A characteristic Hubble scale h0, which is intrinsically related to cosmological constant, marks the boundary between the validity domains of the standard model of cosmology and modified cosmology. Such a role for h0 is similar to Planck&#8217;s constant in the quantum/classical context, or to the speed of light c in the relativity/classical context. For large Hubble parameter, the standard model of cosmology is restored. In the opposite limit of small Hubble parameter, which is the case for present epoch, Lorentz-violating effects would manifest themselves. One of the implications is that there may be no need to invoke dark matter to account for cosmological mass discrepancies.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dmitriy_skripachov">Dmitriy Skripachov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This article describes a new model of gravitation based on idea of interconnection of the gravitational interaction with the curvature of space (but only 3-dimensional, without the &#8221;curvature&#8221; of time). It is proposed to consider the space consisting of unit cells with dimensions comparable to the size of elementary particles. Curvature of space is interpreted through the change in the relative volume of unit cells. In the gravitational field the curva- ture of space is qualified as a decrease in the distension of space with increasing distance from the center of the attracting body. As an important complement of the kinematic relativistic effects of moving bodies is introduced a new kinematic effect of longitudinal distension of comoving space. It is alleged that the gravitational interaction is manifested as a result of following of changes of kinematic effects of moving bodies for change in the local distension of curved space. It is shown that the extrapolation of the fall of matter on the center of the attracting body leads to the conclusion about the existence of density limit, as which can be accepted the matter density of the neutron star.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. The major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!! Although the energy conditions of General Relativity forbids the existence of negative energy the Casimir Effect first predicted by Casimir in $1948$ and verified experimentally by Lamoreaux in $1997$ allows sub-microscopical amounts of it. Lamoreaux obtained experimentally negative energy densities of $10^{-4} \frac{Joules}{Meter^{3}}$.This is an extremely small value $10^{20}$ times lighter than the ones of a body of $1$ kilogram in a cubic meter of space or better:$100.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times lighter than the ones of a body of $1$ kilogram in a cubic meter of space. We introduce in this work a shape function that will low the negative energy density requirements in the Natario warp drive from $10^{48} \frac{Joules}{Meter^{3}}$ to $10^{-7} \frac{Joules}{Meter^{3}}$ a result $1000$ times lighter than the ones obtained by Lamoreaux proving that the Casimir Effect can generate and sustain a Natario warp drive spacetime.We also discuss other warp drive drawbacks:collisions with hazardous interstellar matter(asteroids or comets) that may happen in a real interstellar travel and Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime).</div>

<div class='abstract'>Schiller has shown not only that a maximum force follows from General Relativity, he has also argued that General Relativity can be derived from the principle of maximum force. In the present paper an alternative derivation of maximum force is given. Inspired by the equivalence principle, the approach is based on a modification of the well known special relativity equation for the velocity acquired from uniform proper acceleration. Though in Schiller's derivation the existence of gravitational horizons plays a key role, in the present derivation this is not the case. In fact, though the kinematic equation that we start with does exhibit a horizon, it is not carried over to its gravitational counterpart. A few of the geometrical consequences and physical implications of this result are discussed.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The discovery that the electron current fluctuations through Zener diode $pn$ junctions in reverse bias mode, which arise via quantum barrier tunnelling, are completely driven by space fluctuations, has revolutionised the detection and characterisation of gravitational waves, which are space fluctuations, and also has revolutionised the interpretation of probabilities in the quantum theory. Here we report new data from the very simple and cheap table-top gravitational wave experiment using Zener diode detectors, and reveal the implications for the nature of space and time, and for the quantum theory of ``matter&quot;, and the emergence of the ``classical world&quot; as space-induced wave function localisation. The dynamical space posses an intrinsic inflation epoch with associated fractal turbulence: gravitational waves, perhaps as observed by the BICEP2 experiment in the Antarctica.</div>

<div class='title'>Reconstruction of Ghost Scalar Fields</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mustafa_salti">Mustafa Salti</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In literature, a large number of approaches have been done to reconstruct the potential and dynamics of the scalar fields by establishing a connection between holographic/Ricci/new agegraphic/ghost energy density and a scalar eld model of dark energy. In most of these attempts, the analytical form of the potentials in terms of the scalar eld have not been reconstructed due to the complexity of the equations involved. In the present work, we establish a correspondence between ghost dark energy and quintessence, tachyon and dilaton scalar eld models in anisotropic Bianchi type-I universe to reconstruct the dynamics of these scalar fields.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mustafa_salti">Mustafa Salti</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The main goal of the present work is to investigate the validity of the second law of gravitational thermodynamics in an expanding Godel-type universe filled with generalized Chaplygin gas interacting with cold dark matter. By assuming the Universe as a thermodynamical system bounded by the apparent horizon, and calculating separately the entropy variation for generalized Chaplygin gas, cold dark matter and for the horizon itself, we obtained an expression for the time derivative of the total entropy. We conclude that the 2nd law of gravitational thermodynamics is conditionally valid in the cosmological scenario where the generalized Chaplygin gas interacts with cold dark matter.</div>

<div class='abstract'>It is shown, that the Earth biosphere main parameters, such as the alive matter total mass, the DNA and peptides length, are connected with the observed Universe parameters. In particular, the length of the integral genome DNA of the Earth biosphere is equal to the Hubble radius. The consideration of humanity as the biosphere matter especial part provides us to value the human mass limit and extremal quantity; the obtained results coincide with the ones, calculated by the demography specialists. The obtained relations are explained by the author conception of the synergistical evolutioning Universe, where the nonequilibrium structures, including the alive ones, are created under the action of the observed energy forms as well as of the dark energy. The connection between the biosphere and Universe parameters provides us to extend the Anthropic principle notion as well as the observer conception because the biosphere is an adaptation tracing system, which adjusts itself under the Universe evolution to be the one unit with it.

<div class='title'>Role of the Universe's Background Gravitational Potential in Relativity Concepts</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/arindam_sinha">Arindam Sinha</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper reconciles General Relativity (GR) and Mach's Principle into a consistent, simple and intuitive alternative theory of gravitation. The background gravitational potential from the Universe's matter distribution plays an important role in relativity. This potential far from massive bodies is c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and determines &lt;i&gt;unit&lt;/i&gt; rest mass/energy, which is the essence behind E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The matter distribution creates a local inertial rest frame at every location, in which the Universe gravitational potential is a minimum. A velocity in this frame increases gravitational potential through net blue shift of Universal gravity, causing velocity time dilation, which is a gravitational effect identical to gravitational time dilation. Time dilation increases with velocity, but does not become boundless in general rectilinear motion. The Lorentz factor is the appropriate metric for time dilation only in certain constrained motions. The low velocity approximation of the Lorentz factor scales for all velocities in general rectilinear motion, and speed of light is not the maximum possible speed in such situations. Gravitational time dilation is derived first, and velocity time dilation is derived from it. The mathematics becomes simpler and more intuitive than GR, while remaining consistent with existing experiments. Some experiments are suggested that will show this theory to be more accurate than GR.</div>

<div class='title'>Is the Natario Warp Drive a Valid Candidate for an Interstellar Voyage to the Star System Gliese 667C(GJ 667C)??</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. The major drawback concerning warp drives is the huge amount of negative energy able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $22$ light-years away with $3$ potential habitable exo-planets(Gliese $667C$) at superluminal speeds in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!! We introduce here a shape function that defines the Natario warp drive as an excellent candidate to low the negative energy density requirements from $10^{48}$ to affordable levels.We also discuss other warp drive drawbacks:collisions with hazardous interstellar matter(asteroids or comets) that may happen in a real interstellar travel from Earth to Gliese $667C$ and Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime).We terminate this work with a description of the star system Gliese $667C$</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/william_o_straub">William O. Straub</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 1918 the German mathematician Hermann Weyl developed a non-Riemannian geometry in which electromagnetism appeared to emerge naturally as a consequence of the non-invariance of vector magnitude. Although an initial admirer of the theory, Einstein declared the theory unphysical on the basis of the non-invariance of the line element ds, which is arbitrarily rescaled from point to point in the geometry. We examine the Weyl theory and trace its failure to its inability to accommodate certain vectors that are inherently scale invariant. A revision of the theory is suggested that appears to refute Einstein&#8217;s objection.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We consider the extension of the Schwarzschild metric to a counterpart that can describe an extended spherically symmetric stellar body with acceptable density distribution, and with a thermal profile. With a length parameter, apart from the Schwarzschild radius, the proposed metric can fit the values of density, pressure, and temperature, at the stellar surface, and give a complete profile down to the core. Such a metric extension seems to describe a central core with an &quot;energy-producing, explosive core&quot;, as well as an inflationary &quot;coronal windy layer&quot;, two regions where the mean pressure seems to acquire negative magnitudes. Our illustrative computations and graphical illustrations refer to the sun as a reference example. We discuss the Schwarzschild limit of such metrical model.

<div class='abstract'>The radiational contributions, electromagnetic and gravitational, to energy density in the cosmological equation must be negative. This creates natural turning points for a cyclic cosmological model. The negative pressure of the electromagnetic radiation would prevent the collapse of the universe in a prior contracting phase, while the positive pressure of the gravitational radiation would prevent it from expanding forever. Such a cosmological model avoids the problems of a singular past, and evades an ever-accelerating future. The picture is that of an oscillating universe full of stars, that eternally build and destroy the various forms of matter and life, all in a framework of energy conservation. Assuming that the temperature of microwave radiation is a true measure of the electromagnetic energy density of the universe, and that the supernovae data and redshifts are reliable, we can determine (tentatively) the parameters of our model, with an appropriate Hubble fraction of 0.50, and a deceleration parameter of 0.55, and estimate the time that passed, about 12.8 Gyr, since the initiation of the expansion phase, and the time that remains, about 1066 Gyr, before the return to contraction.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We present a continuous counterpart to Schwarzschild's metrical model of a constant-density sphere.

Whereas the radial part of pressure shows a positive distribution for all values of radial distance, the angular part of pressure shows negative magnitudes in the upper layers of low density; both pressures vanishing for infinite distance. We speculate that the negative pressure effect might be connected with stellar winds. Studying the motions of photons and massive particles in the gravity field of the continuous model shows similar, however continuous, behaviors to those described before for Schwarzschild's constant-density model.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/n_s_baaklini">N.S. Baaklini</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We give an elementary analysis of the classical motion of a particle in the spherically symmetric gravitational field of a Schwarzschild source, with due regard to energy conservation. We observe that whereas a massive particle at large distances could be attracted towards the central source, it would however encounter repulsion as it comes close to the Schwarzschild surface. We also note that there is a limited energy range for which the radial motion is ruled by attraction. An attracted incoming particle reaches a maximum speed at a specific distance greater than the Schwarzschild radius, before decelerating to zero, then bouncing back. Like the radial motion, the orbital motion around a Schwarzschild source would stop at the Schwarzschild radius. A massless photon would always be repelled, with its speed decreasing as it approaches the source, ultimately getting reflected at the Schwarzschild surface. The timing problem associated with surface singularity is resolved by regarding particles as Schwarzschild sources themselves. We depict a picture of ideal Schwarzschild sources as mutually repulsive bubbles endowed with reflecting surfaces.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the hyperverse model, particles of matter are collapsed and coalesced quanta of space, created by a condensation process to conserve angular momentum and centripetal force. We have proposed that the component quanta have spin, and hypothesize here that upon particle formation, the collapsed and coalesced component quanta are fixed in orientation so that either their north or south poles face the particle center. Six coalesced vortices produce structures that can account for all charge variations, including fractional charges and anti-particles. Fractional charges are net charges, where charge is a consequence of the spin orientations. The model suggests that protons carry a hidden negative one charge, speculated to be what stops the electron from falling into the proton. We hypothesize that &quot;condensation neutrinos&quot; exist, neutrinos made by the natural condensation route of particle creation, and these lack the high kinetic energy of &quot;emission neutrinos&quot;, created as a result of atomic decay and collision. Condensation neutrinos would be the most numerous particle, but difficult to detect, and may be the dark matter particle.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Origin of Matter and Gravity: What They Are and Why They Exist</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_tassano">James A. Tassano</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We show a group of equations that appear to represent target values for the mass, radius, and number of elementary particles in the universe: the values of an 'ideal particle'. Quanta and particles are not static; they change with time. The angular momentum of the universe is continually increasing, and this requires a dynamical response to conserve angular momentum. The creation, collapse, and coalescence of quanta conserves angular momentum, resulting in the creation of particles of matter. Matter is condensed space. The increase in the gravitational potential energy of particles matches the accretion rate of energy predicted by this model. This gives a simple, universe-wide mechanism for the creation of matter, and is the reason all elementary particles, of a kind, are identical. The centripetal force of a particle of matter matches the gravitational force; they are the same entity. Gravity is the ongoing accretion of the quanta of space by particles of matter.</div>

<div class='title'>A Universe from Itself: The Geometric Mean Expansion of Space and the Creation of Quanta</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_tassano">James A. Tassano</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We explore indications that the universe is undergoing a geometric mean expansion. Developing this concept requires the creation of two quantum levels, one being the quantum of our quantum mechanics, and another that is much smaller. The generation of quanta is what allows space to expand. We find that quanta are not static entities, but change with time; for example, the energy of quanta decreases, and the number of quanta increases, with time. The observable universe grows while the quantum levels shrink, giving a simple mechanism to explain the expansion of the universe. The universe does not come from nothing; it comes from itself.</div>

<div class='title'>A Model of Time based on the Expansion of Space</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_tassano">James A. Tassano</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We present a model relating the expansion of space to time. We previously modeled the universe a hyperverse, expanding into the fourth dimension at twice the speed of light. We claim here that the 2c radial expansion gives us the one-way arrow of time. We further hypothesize that the surface of the hyperverse consists of a matrix of vortices, self-similar to the observable hyperverse, and that these vortices, which have the same energy, tangential velocity, and frequency, are the building blocks of both space and matter. Their 2c radial expansion allows a quantization of time. We show that there is an energy connected to time, derived from the centripetal velocity of the vortices. Relative motion decreases centripetal velocity, and consequently, perceived frequency. The time dilation function of special relativity is derived from the ratio of the centripetal velocities of the observer and the observed. Time is created by hyperverse radial expansion and the energy and spin characteristics of the quanta of space.</div>

<div class='title'>The Hubble Constant is a Measure of the Increase in the Energy of the Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_tassano">James A. Tassano</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We postulate the universe to be the three dimensional surface volume of an expanding, hollow, four dimensional hypersphere, called the hyperverse. Using current measurements, we find that a hyperverse, whose surface volume matches the volume of the observable universe, has a radius of 27.7 billion light years, giving a radial expansion rate of twice the speed of light, and a circumferential expansion rate that matches the Hubble constant. We show that the Hubble constant is a measure of the increase in the energy of the universe, implying the hyperverse surface, our universe, is composed of energy. The 2c radial expansion both sets the speed limit in the universe, and is the basis of time. The hypersphere model provides a positively curved, and closed universe, and its 2c radial expansion rate, and circumferential expansion rate matching the Hubble expansion, give strong support that the universe is the 3D surface volume of an expanding 4D hypersphere.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper serves two aims: First, it wraps up the previous parts.

It is my hope that a future generation of physicists will rediscover the wealth of experimental simplicity for its own, and not for the pleasure and confirmation of any given physical theory. Experiments document the current state of affairs. They live through their repetition and continuous revision by experts and amateurs.

<div class='title'>Consistent Extra Time Dimensions: Cosmological Inflation with Inflaton Potential Identically Equal to Zero</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/patrick_lee_nash">Patrick Lee Nash</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Inflation supported by a real massless scalar inflaton field $\varphi$ whose potential is identically equal to zero is described. Assuming that inflation takes place after the Plank scale (after quantum gravity effects are important), zero potential is concomitant with an initial condition for $\varphi$ that is exponentially more probable than an initial condition that assumes an initial inflaton potential of order of the Planck mass. The Einstein gravitational field equations are formulated on an eight-dimensional spacetime manifold of four space dimensions and four time dimensions. The field equations are sourced by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the real massless scalar inflaton field $\varphi$. Two solution classes for the coupled Einstein field equations are obtained that exhibit temporal exponential \textbf{deflation of three of the four time dimensions} and temporal exponential inflation of three of the four space dimensions. For brevity this phenomenon is sometimes simply called ``inflation.&quot; We show that \textbf{the extra time dimensions do not generally induce the exponentially rapid growth of fluctuations of quantum fields.} Comoving coordinates for the two \textbf{unscaled} dimensions are chosen to be $(x^4 , x^8 )$ (unscaled means a constant scale factor equal to one). The $x^4$ coordinate corresponds to our universe's observed physical time dimension, while the $x^8$ coordinate corresponds to a new spatial dimension that may be compact. $\partial_{x^8}$ terms of $\varphi$ and the metric are seen to play the role of an effective inflaton potential in the dynamical field equations. In this model, after ``inflation&quot; the observable physical macroscopic world appears to a classical observer to be a homogeneous, isotropic universe with three space dimensions and one time dimension.</div>

<div class='title'>The Analysis of Barcelo,Finazzi and Liberati applied to both Alcubierre and Natario Warp Drive Spacetimes: Horizons,Infinite Doppler Blueshifts and Quantum Instabilities(Natario &lt;&gt; Alcubierre)</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However as stated by both Alcubierre and Natario themselves the warp drive violates all the known energy conditions because the stress energy momentum tensor is negative implying in a negative energy density. While from a classical point of view the negative energy is forbidden the Quantum Field Theory allows the existence of very small amounts of it being the Casimir effect a good example as stated by Alcubierre himself.The major drawback concerning negative energies for the warp drive is the huge amount of negative energy able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform an interstellar space travel to a &quot;nearby&quot; star at $20$ light-years away with $3$ potential habitable exo-planets(Gliese $667c$) at superluminal speeds in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!!! Some years ago Barcelo,Finazzi and Liberati published a work in which the composed mixed tensor $\langle {T_\mu}^\nu\rangle$ obtained from the negative energy density tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ $\mu=0,\nu=0$ of the $1+1$ dimensional Alcubierre warp drive metric diverges when the velocity of the ship $vs$ exceeds the speed of light.(see pg $2$ in \cite{ref19}).We demonstrate in this work that in fact this do not happens and their results must be re-examined.We introduce here a shape function that defines the Natario warp drive spacetime as an excellent candidate to low the negative energy density requirements from $10^{48}$ to affordable levels.We also discuss Horizons and Doppler Blueshifts that affects the Alcubierre spacetime but not the Natario counterpart.</div>

<div class='title'>The Gravitational Origin of Velocity Time Dilation: A Generalization of the Lorentz Factor for Comparable Masses</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/arindam_sinha">Arindam Sinha</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Does velocity time dilation (clock drift) depend on a body's velocity in the Center of Gravity Frame of the local gravitational system, rather than on relative velocities between bodies? Experiments that have measured differential clock rates have conclusively proven this to be true, and hinted at a gravitational origin of velocity time dilation. Extending this understanding, a generalized form of the velocity time dilation metric (Lorentz factor) including masses is derived. This allows prediction of velocity time dilation between bodies of any mass ratio, including comparable masses such as the Earth-Moon system. This is not possible using the Lorentz factor in its current form. The generalized form of the Lorentz factor remains consistent with results of all experiments conducted.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Several non-fiducial cosmological tests are discussed allowing various models to be conclusively differentiated from one another. The four models tested include &#923;CDM, the Friedmann-Lemaitre metric and a recently proposed steady state with and without local expansion. The cosmological tests range from redshift versus distance modulus to the angular size and time dependence of distant objects. Recent observations allow strict constraints on both the size and evolution of faint blue galaxies up to 23B. The solution to the faint blue galaxy problem is further discussed relative to size versus absolute magnitude, number densities and observations of minimal evolution. Models with expanding metrics are ruled out due to incorrect predictions of angular diameter distance and time-dependence. Observations instead depict a steady state universe with asymptotically flat gravitational potential and embedded bulk flows.</div>

<div class='title'>Fractal Structure of the Universe</div>

<div class='abstract'>Hierarchic fractal structure of the Universe enabling to redefine its observed characteristics is considered. According to the hypothesis the Universe consists of an infinite number of spatial and hierarchic fractal levels of matter that are nested within each other (fractals mean self-similar events, processes and spatial forms) and represented as moving spaces, presumably of a spherical shape. Distinguished in ascending order are the following basic fractals of the Universe that are conventionally connected with the kinds of matter interaction: nuclear, atomic, electromagnetic and gravitational. It can also be assumed that there exist fractals which are older than the gravitational ones. Each fractal is characterized by finite geometrical dimensions and finite value of its own energy, consequently, by the finite value of the spatial density of energy. Whenever the lower hierarchic level fractals (nuclear) transit to the higher levels (gravitational), the space and spatial density of energy inflate, and their information variety increases (as a sum of informational variety of spatial and energy forms and their levels). At transit from the lower level fractals to the higher level fractals the energy density inflates which leads to that (i) each fractal type is characterized by the finite maximum transfer velocity of internal physical interaction, and (ii) this velocity increases. It means that the maximum transit physical interaction velocity within the gravitational fractal exceeds the velocity of light which is the maximum for the electromagnetic fractal while the maximum transit physical interaction velocity of the atomic fractal is lower than the velocity of light (it is reduced by the fine structure constant). The fractal structure of the Universe hypothesis makes it possible for the authors to put forward several other assumptions: dark energy does not exist and the apparent effect of its presence in the electromagnetic fractal as well as appearance of asymmetry between the matter and antimatter are explained by its finite geometrical dimensions, spherical shape and rotational motion of this sphere around at least one of the axes.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Gravity Probe B (GP-B) experiment measured the geodetic precession due to parallel transport in a curved space-time metric, as predicted by de Sitter, Fokker and Schiff. Schiff included the Thomas precession in his treatment and argued that it should be zero in a free fall orbit. We review the existing interpretations regarding the relation between the Thomas precession and the geodetic precession for a gyroscope in a free fall orbit. Schiff and Parker had contradictory views on the status of the Thomas precession in a free fall orbit, a contradiction that continues to exist in the literature. In the second part of this paper we derive the geodetic precession as a global Thomas Precession by use of the Equivalent Principle and some elements of hyperbolic geometry, a derivation that allows the treatment of GP--B physics in between SR and GR courses.</div>

<div class='title'>Relativity and the Universe Gravitational Potential</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/arindam_sinha">Arindam Sinha</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper reconciles General Relativity (GR) and Mach's Principle into a consistent, simple and intuitive alternative theory of gravitation. The Universe's ubiquitous background gravitational potential plays an important role in relativity concepts. This gravitational potential (energy per unit mass) far from all massive bodies is c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which determines &lt;i&gt;unit&lt;/i&gt; rest mass/energy, and is the essence behind E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Universal matter distribution creates a local inertial rest frame at every location, in which the Universe gravitational potential is a minimum. A velocity in this frame increases this gravitational potential through net blue shift of Universal gravity, causing velocity time dilation, which is a gravitational effect identical to gravitational time dilation. Velocity time dilation from this increase of gravitational potential is found to be same as computed from the low velocity approximation of Lorentz factor. The current Lorentz Factor is applicable only in situations where a local potential is dominant compared to the Universe potential. Time dilation increases with velocity, but does not become boundless for general rectilinear motion in the Universe. Speed of light is not the maximum possible speed in such situations, but only in circumstances where the Lorentz Factor is the appropriate metric. Gravitational time dilation is derived first, and velocity time dilation is derived from it. The mathematics becomes much simpler and more intuitive than GR, while remaining consistent with existing experiments. Some experiments are suggested that will show this theory to be more accurate than GR.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In spite of the widespread fanfare of the 1998 discovery of a positive accelerating expansion and the subsequent need for a &#8220;Dark Energy&#8221; placeholder in physics, the one geometric component that seems to share a relationship, the Cosmological Constant, has become shrouded in even more questions by it. After a century of concentrated efforts, the mounting lack of forthcoming answers has &#8220;driven&#8221; the NSF/ NASA/DOE Dark Energy Task Force to consider whether general relativity is &#8220;incorrect&#8221;. In keeping with this reluctant but forced skepticism we subject an early competitor to general relativity, Gunnar Nordstr&#168;oms version of the Poisson equation, to a more stringent definition utilizing an asymmetric property of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. We derive from this property a new metric Laplacian definition for flatness that in perturbed spherical symmetry form greatly resembles the Schwarzschild solution. However, this metric version would seem capable of uniting gravity with QFT by utilizing the widely considered equivalence of the Cosmological Constant with a proposed large value vacuum energy density but at the expense of differential topology and our understanding of tensors in general. A much larger penalty though seems to be that it results in a geometrical counterpoint to the physical explanations for general relativity, QFT and energy density.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Pound-Rebka experiment is a famous experiment to test the theory of general relativity and is taken as paradigm for probing that Einstein's relativity is true. In this experiment there are two Doppler effects involved, namely the gravitational Doppler effect predicted by GR (General Relativity) and the inertial Doppler effect predicted by SR (Special Relativity). Each kind of effect is modelled by its own equations. In this experiment, the aim was to balance both effects in order to attain a null effective Doopler effect, so electromagnetic frequency resulted to yield the same measured value as the original emitted frequency. That implied that if photons were emitted from the top of the tower towards the ground detector, the gravitational Doppler effect would be a Doppler blue shitf, it is to say, a frequency increase. But, if those photons were emitted fron the ground towards the top of the tower, the detector sited in that top would measure a lower frequency for the same gravitacional Doppler effect. In order to achieve the relative inertial movement required by SR, the emission source of photons was placed in the center of a loudspeaker cone, so by vibrating the speaker cone the source moved with varying speed, thus creating varying Doppler shifts.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This is the second installment in a four part series, the aim of the work being to introduce absolute motion into Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity (STR). Herein, we depart from the traditional case where one twin stays put while the other rockets into space, we consider the case of identically accelerated twins. Both twins depart at uniform relativistic speeds in opposite directions for a round trip from the Earth on their 21th birthday destined into space to some distant constellation that is a distance L_0 in the rest frame of the Earth. A proper application of Einstein's STR tells us that the Earth bound observers will conclude that on the day of reunion, both twins must both have aged the same albeit their clocks (which where initially synchronized with that of the Earth bound observers) will have registered a duration less than that registered by the Earth bound observers. In the traditional twin paradox, it is argued that the stay at home twin will have aged more than the traveling twin and the asymmetry is attributed to the fact that the traveling twin's frame of reference is not an inertial reference frame during the periods of acceleration and deceleration making it ``illegal&quot; for the traveling twin to use the STR in their frame, thus ``resolving&quot; the paradox. This same argument does not hold in the case considered here as both twins will undergo identical experiences where each twin sees the other as the one that is in motion. This means, each twin must conclude that the other twin is the one that is younger. They will conclude that their ages must be numerically different, thus disagreeing with the Earth bound observers that their ages are the same. This leads us to a true paradox that throws Einstein's Philosophy of Relativity into complete disarray.</div>

From within the domains, confines and provinces of Einstein's STR, we argue without considering the accelerations and decelerations, where we show that, indeed, it is the ``travelling&quot; twin that is younger at the point of reunion. This brings us to a point of admission that there is indeed a twin who really does the travelling and another that does t he staying at home. Hidden within the labyrinth of its seemingly coherent and consistent structure and fabric, does Einstein's STR imply absolute motion -- we ask? This is the question that we leave hanging in the mind of the reader. In the next reading, we propose a new version of the twin paradox, where the scenario is truly symmetric from either of the twin's reference systems -- we have coined this, the ``Symmetric Twin Paradox (STP)&quot;. This version (STP) unearths an irretrievable contradiction hidden at the deepest and subtle level of Einstein's STR. It is shown that Einstein's STR is unable to resolve this irretrievable contradiction, even if the accelerations and decelerations are taken into. Not even Einstein's General Theory of Relativity can be brought to the rescue in the case of the STP. In our third instalment, we shall setforth a new version of the STR where absolute motion is permitted. This version solves the symmetric twin paradox and any known paradox of relativity. Lastly, we apply this new STR where absolute motion is permitted to experimental efforts that have been made to measure absolute motion. Most well trained physicists tend to ignore completely, readings purporting to go against Einstein's STR. We would like to persuade our reader to make a brief stop and consider for a minute, what we have to say in our four part series of readings.</div>

<div class='title'>Is the State of Low Energy Stable? Negative Energy, Dark Energy and Dark Matter</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The principle, which says &#8220;the state of low energy is stable&#8221;, is one of the fundamental principles of Physics, and it has its influences on across all the fields of Physics. In this article, we will reveal that this principle is an incomplete. It is stable at a low energy state in the case of positive mass (energy), whereas, it is stable at a high energy state in the case of negative mass (energy). Due to this, &#8220;the problem of transition to minus infinite energy level&#8221; does not occur, therefore negative energy and positive energy can coexist. Moreover, we will show that negative energy provides an explanation for dark matter and dark energy, which are the biggest issues posed to cosmology at the present. We demonstrate the ratio between matter, dark matter and dark energy through this model, and computer simulation shows that this assumption is appropriate. &#923;CDM model expects that the ratio of matter and dark matter will be constant, but this model suggests that as the universe expands, the gravitational effect of matter vs. dark matter differs. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the change of the ratio (&#937;_d/&#937;_m).</div>

<div class='title'>Unification of Mass and Gravitation in a Common 4D Higgs Compatible Theory</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jacky_jerome">Jacky JEROME</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Since the 1920s, the formulas of mass and gravitation have worked perfectly with high accuracy. However, the basic principle of these two phenomena remains unknown. What is the origin of mass? How can spacetime be curved by mass? What is the mechanism by which spacetime creates gravitation? . . . The solution to these enigmas lies in general relativity. A thorough examination of the Einstein Field Equations highlights some minor inconsistencies concerning the sign and the meaning of tensors. Solving these inconsistencies fully explains the curvature of spacetime, mass, and gravitation, without modifying the mathematics of general relativity. Moreover, this explanation shows that mass and gravitation are two similar phenomena that can be unified in a common 4D Higgs compatible theory. Applications to astrophysics are also very important: black holes, dark matter, dark energy. . .</div>

<div class='abstract'>It is shown a.o. that a gauge invariant scalar (classical and quantum theoretical) electrodynamical field is a trivial field theory; in fact, it is shown that a non-zero scalar gauge field will not be charge/mass conservating, unless it is zero. The classical action of a flux of charged and neutral particles is calculated. It is shown that this action is a spinor field $\Psi$ which satisfies $\Box \Psi=0$, i.e.: the action of neutral and charged currents of particles spreads at the speed of light, a result which was already shown in Part1 of this paper by other means. The fact that both solutions differ only by a constant factor $\gamma^0$, suggests that electromagnetic and gravitational field are of the same nature. Now, why is the gravitational force so much weaker than electromagnetic one? A hint can perhaps be given with Part2.</div>

<div class='title'>Calculation of the Hubble Parameter from Geometry</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/patrick_l_nash">Patrick L. Nash</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is shown that the field equations of Einstein gravity sourced by a real massless scalar inflaton field $\varphi$, with inflaton potential identically equal to zero, cast on an eight-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold $\mathbb{X}_{4,4}$ (a spacetime of four space dimensions and four time dimensions) admit a solution that exhibits temporal exponential \textbf{deflation of three of the four time dimensions} and temporal exponential inflation of three of the four space dimensions. [The signature and dimension of $\mathbb{X}_{4,4}$ are chosen because its tangent spaces satisfy a triality principle \cite{Nash2010} (Minkowski vectors and spinors are equivalent).] Comoving coordinates for the two \textbf{unscaled} dimensions are chosen to be $(x^4 \leftrightarrow \textrm{ time}, x^8 \leftrightarrow \textrm{ space})$. The $x^4$ coordinate corresponds to our universe's observed physical time dimension. The $x^8$ coordinate corresponds to a compact spatial dimension with circumference $C_8$. $C_8$ determines the initial value of the Hubble parameter $H$. Most importantly, this model describes an initially inflating/deflating Universe created with inflaton potential identically equal to zero, which is an initial condition that is exponentially more probable than an initial condition that assumes an initial inflaton potential of order of the Planck mass. This model predicts that the Hubble parameter $H$ during inflation is $ H = \frac{\pi}{3 \, C_8} $.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Dark energy and dark matter constitute about 95% of the Universe. Nonetheless, not much is known about them. Existing theories, including General Relativity, fail to provide plausible definitions of the two entities, or to predict their amounts in the Universe. The present paper proposes a new special relativity theory, called Complete Relativity theory (CR) that is anchored in Galileo&#8217;s relativity, but without the notion of a preferred frame. The theory results are consistent with Newtonian and Quantum mechanics. More importantly, the theory yields natural definitions of dark energy and dark matter and predicts the content of the Universe with high accuracy.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Divergence of the Negative Energy Density Equation in both Alcubierre and Natario Warp Drive Spacetimes: No Divergence At All</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However as stated by both Alcubierre and Natario themselves the warp drive violates all the known energy conditions because the stress energy momentum tensor is negative implying in a negative energy density. While from a classical point of view the negative energy is forbidden the Quantum Field Theory allows the existence of very small amounts of it being the Casimir effect a good example as stated by Alcubierre himself.The major drawback concerning negative energies for the warp drive is the huge amount of negative energy able to sustain the warp bubble.In order to perform interstellar space travel to &quot;nearby&quot; stars at $20$ light-years away with potential habitable exo-planets(eg:Gliese $581$) at superluminal speeds in a reasonable amount of time a ship must attain a speed of about $200$ times faster than light.However the negative energy density at such a speed is directly proportional to the factor $10^{48}$ which is $1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000$ times bigger in magnitude than the mass of the planet Earth!!! Some years ago Hiscock published a work in which the composed mixed tensor $\langle {T_\mu}^\nu\rangle$ obtained from the negative energy density tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ $\mu=0,\nu=0$ of the two-dimensional Alcubierre warp drive metric diverges when the velocity of the ship $vs$ exceeds the speed of light.(see pg $2$ in \cite{ref4}).We demonstrate in this work that in fact this do not happens and the Hiscock result must be re-examined.We introduce here a shape function that defines the Natario warp drive spacetime as an excellent candidate to low the negative energy density requirements from $10^{48}$ to affordable levels.We also discuss Horizons and Doppler Blueshifts that affects the Alcubierre spacetime but not the Natario counterpart.</div>

<div class='abstract'>All alleged black hole models pertain to a universe that is spatially infinite, is eternal, contains only one mass, is not expanding, and is asymptotically flat or asymptotically not flat. But the alleged big bang cosmology pertains to a universe that is spatially finite (one case) or spatially infinite (two different cases), is of finite age, contains radiation and many masses including multiple black holes (some of which are primordial), is expanding, and is not asymptotically anything. Thus the black hole and the big bang contradict one another - they are mutually exclusive. It is surprisingly easy to prove that neither General Relativity nor Newton's theory predicts the black hole. Despite numerous claims for discovery of black holes in their millions, nobody has ever actually found one. It is also not difficult to prove that General Relativity violates the usual conservation of energy and momentum. Fundamentally there are contradictions contained in black hole theory, big bang cosmology, and General Relativity. Numerical methods are therefore to no avail.</div>

<div class='title'>A Modification of Cosmological Friedman-Robertson-Walk Metric</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chiyi_chen">ChiYi Chen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we firstly present an explicit dynamical equation which satisfies the general principle of relativity under the framework of classical mechanics. In light of this fact, the necessity of Einstein's equivalence principle for the gravity being geometrized should be reexamined. Especially, Einstein's (strong) equivalence principle claims that the inertial force is equivalent to the gravitational force on physical effect. But in fact the new dynamical equation proves that the essence of the inertial force is the real force exerted on the reference object, which can actually be all kinds of forces such as the gravitational force, electromagnetic force and so on. Therefore, in this context we only retain the numerical equality between the inertial mass and gravitational mass and abandon Einstein's (strong) equivalence principle. Consequently, the candidate for the standard clock should be corrected into the mathematical clock which duplicates the real clock equipped by the observer himself. Then an adjusted physical picture for how to convert the gravitational force into a geometric description on space-time is presented. On the other hand, we point out that all cosmological observations are made by the observer at the present time on the earth, instead of any other observers including the comoving observers in the earlier unverse. On this basis, we introduce an extra factor $b(t)$ in $FRW$ cosmological metric to depict the gravitational time dilation effect since the local proper clock may run in a faster and faster rate with the expanding of the universe. In this way, we may obtain a positive value of $\rho+3p$ and avoid the introduction of dark energy in the current universe.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/rodrigo_de_abreu">Rodrigo de Abreu</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/vasco_guerra">Vasco Guerra</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The traditional presentation of special relativity is made from a rupture with previous ideas, such as the notion of absolute motion, emphasizing the antagonism of the Lorentz-Poincar&#233;'s views and Einstein's ideas. However, a weaker formulation of the postulates allows to recover all the mathematical results from Einstein's special relativity and reveals that both viewpoints are merely different perspectives of one and the same theory. The apparent contradiction simply stems from different procedures for clock &quot;synchronization,&quot; associated with different choices of the coordinates used to describe the physical world. Even very fundamental claims, such as the constancy of the speed of light, relativity of simultaneity and relativity of time dilation, are seen to be no more than a consequence of a misleading language adopted in the description of the physical reality, which confuses clock rhythms with clock time readings. Indeed, the latter depend on the &quot;synchronization&quot; adopted, whereas the former do not. As such, these supposedly fundamental claims are not essential aspects of the theory, as reality is not altered by a mere change of coordinates. The relation between the rhythms of clocks in relative motion is derived with generality. This relation, which is not the standard textbook expression, markedly exposes the indeterminacy of special relativity, connected with the lack of knowledge of the value of the one-way speed of light. Moreover, the theory does not collapse and remains valid if some day the one-way speed of light is truly measured and the indeterminacy is removed. It is further shown that the slow transport method of &quot;synchronization&quot; cannot be seen as distinct from Einstein's procedure.</div>

<div class='title'>Investigation of the Formalism of Particle Dynamics Under the Framework of Classical Mechanics</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chiyi_chen">ChiYi Chen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we reconstruct the formulism of particle dynamics under the framework of classical mechanics according to the causal consistency principle, and obtain a new particle dynamical equation. In this derivation there is a most natural and simple assumption that an absolute background of space exists. Because in essence, the absolute background of space must be distinguished from the relative scales of space. The existence of an absolute background can not only be mostly compatible with the physical logic in special theory of relativity, but also retains the most fundamental elements in our intuitional experience. Certainly, the absolute background of space is also the underlying part of Newton's absolute view of space-time. In the application of the new dynamical equation, inertial reference frames are no longer required and inertial forces are no longer introduced by hand. This new dynamical equation can be directly applied in any reference frame which is irrotational with respect to the absolute background of space, namely a moderate general principle of relativity is realized on particle dynamics. The nature of the inertial force is nothing but the real forces exerted on the reference object. Further analysis illustrates that the new particle dynamical equation is more in line with the empirical laws of classical mechanics experiments, than the traditional theoretical formula of Newton's second law.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/radwan_m_kassir">Radwan M. Kassir</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, the Lorentz transformation equations are closely examined in connection with the constancy of the speed of light postulate of the special relativity. This study demonstrates that the speed of light postulate is implicitly manifested in the transformation under the form of space-to-time ratio invariance, which has the implication of collapsing the light sphere to a straight line, and rendering the frames of reference origin-coordinates undetermined with respect to each other. Yet, Lorentz transformation is shown to be readily constructible based on this conflicting finding. Consequently, the formulated Lorentz transformation is deemed to generate mathematical contradictions, thus defying its tenability. A rationalization of the isolated contradictions is then established. An actual interpretation of the Lorentz transformation is presented, demonstrating the unreality of the space-time conversion property attributed to the transformation.</div>

The space and time are treated as imaginary concepts. With this, the electrodynamics and gravitational phenomena can be explained with a Galilean invariant vacuum. Also a new way to explain the gravitational attraction will result.</div>

<div class='title'>Quantum Information and Cosmology: the Connections</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/a_garces_doz">A.Garc&#233;s Doz</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The information or knowledge we can get from a quantum state, depends on the interaction of this state with the measurement process itself. As we know, this involves an uncertainty in the amount of information and accuracy of this knowledge. Now we ask: is there an information content intrinsic and independent of the observer, in quantum reality? Our answer is a resounding, yes. More precisely, we show that this information is encoded on surfaces, and specifically in circular compactifications. That is, there is a holograph on surfaces. In this encoding of quantum information will call as the strong holographic principle. Due to the application of this principle, it will show as the Higgs vacuum value implies a subtle correction by entropic uncertainty. The connections of quantum information, to cosmology, are clearly shown when the values of the dark energy density approxeq = ln2;and matter density Omega_{m}= Omega_{c}+ Omega_{b}, approxeq = 1-ln2. It showed that the equation of the energy-momentum has five solutions by factoring by two components which appear in terms of mass and imaginary momentum. Far from being a mere mathematical artifice, we see that these states should exist, and that our interpretation of them is that every particle appears to be a mixture of two states, one of them unobservable, having an imaginary component. In other words: these involve imaginary states faster than the speed of light, without contradicting Special Relativity, as we shall see. Failure to observe Cherenkov radiation forces us to determine which are virtual states. These five states also appear to be related to the minimum number of microstates which generate the group E8. Finally: all these results lead us to postulate a particle candidate to the dark matter, of approximately 9,2 Gev.</div>

<div class='title'>Special Relativity With Apparent Simultaneity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/michael_devine">Michael Devine</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We consider a model of special relativity in which standard simultaneity is replaced by an alternative defined per observer by the direct appearance of simultaneity. The postulates of special relativity are interpreted to permit it, using a corresponding measure of distance chosen so that the measurement of light&#8217;s speed remains invariant with a value of c. The relativistic Doppler effect and Lorentz transformation of time are derived from direct observations without consideration of a delay of light. Correspondence of the model with SR is further shown by finding a displaced observer whose measure of apparent simultaneity is identical to a given observer&#8217;s measure of standard simultaneity. The advantages of apparent simultaneity include unifying apparent delay of light with relative simultaneity, and unifying changes to relative simultaneity with change in observer position. With speculative interpretation the model implies an equivalence of time and distance.</div>

<div class='title'>Newtonian Gravitation with Radially Varying Velocity-Dependent Mass</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/henrik_agerhall">Henrik Agerh&#228;ll</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A new extension to Newtonian celestial mechanics is examined. We focus on the scenario of a point-like body with negligible mass orbiting a spherically symmetric massive body. We take the implicitly time-dependent mass of electrodynamics one step further. We let the mass of the orbiting body vary not only with the velocity, but also with the position within the gravitational field. We find a family of expressions for the gravitational acceleration that explains the anomalous precession of perihelion of the planets and in the strong field limit results in orbits in close agreement with the predictions of the Schwarzschild solution. Regarding the orbital velocity of a body in circular orbit and the acceleration of a body at rest, the new theory gives the same results as classically. This is not the case with the post-Newtonian expansion even if terms at the third post-Newtonian, 3PN, level are included. Arguably, the major benefit of the new theory is that it presents a method that is much less intricate and more practical to deal with than general relativity, while reproducing most of its results, at least in the spherically symmetric case. While the differences between the final expression and the corresponding expression from the post-Newtonian expansion are small and subtle, the new theory gives results that in several ways are closer to both the classical results and to what the Schwarzschild solution predicts.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We present two models combining some aspects of the Galilei and the Special Relativity that leads to a unification of both relativities. This unification is founded on a reinterpretation of the absolute time of the Galilei relativity that is considered as a quantity in its own and not as mere reinterpretation of the time of the Special relativity in the limit of low velocity. In the first model, the Galilei relativity plays a prominent role in the sense that the basic kinematical laws of Special relativity, e.g. the Lorentz transformation and the velocity law, follows from the corresponding Galilei transformations for the position and velocity. This first model also provides a new way of conceiving the nature of relativistic spacetime where the Lorentz transformation is induced by the Galilei transformation through an embedding of 3-dimensional Euclidean space into hyperplanes of 4-dimensional Euclidean space. This idea provides the starting point for the development of a second model that leads to a generalization of the Lorentz transformation, which includes, as particular cases, the standard Lorentz transformation and transformations that apply to the case of superluminal frames.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However as stated by both Alcubierre and Natario themselves the warp drive violates all the known energy conditions because the stress energy momentum tensor(the right side of the Einstein Field Equations) for the Einstein tensor $G_{00}$ is negative implying in a negative energy density. While from a classical point of view the negative energy is forbidden the Quantum Field Theory allows the existence of very small amounts of it being the Casimir effect a good example as stated by Alcubierre himself.The major drawback concerning negative energies for the warp drive are the huge negative energy density requirements to sustain a stable warp bubble configuration. Ford and Pfenning computed these negative energy and concluded that at least $10$ times the mass of the Universe is required to sustain a warp bubble configuration. However both Alcubierre and Natario warp drives as members of the same family of the Einstein Field Equations requires the so-called shape functions in order to be mathematically defined. We present in this work two new shape functions for the Natario warp drive spacetime based on the Heaviside step function and one of these functions allows arbitrary superluminal speeds while keeping the negative energy density at &quot;low&quot; and &quot;affordable&quot; levels.We do not violate any known law of quantum physics and we maintain the original geometry of the Natario warp drive spacetime We also discuss briefly Horizons and infinite Doppler blueshifts.</div>

<div class='title'>Pedagogical Use of Relativistic Mass at Better Visualization of Special Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/janko_kokosar">Janko Kokosar</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Relativistic mass is not incorrect. The main argument against it is that it does not tell us anything more than the relativistic energy tells us. In this paper it is shown that this is not true, because new aspects of special relativity (SR) can be presented. One reason for this definition is to show a relation between time dilation and relativistic mass. This relation can be further used to present a connection between space-time and matter more clearly, and to show that space-time does not exist without matter. This means even a simpler presentation than is shown with Einstein's general covariance. Therefore, this opposes that SR is only a theory of space-time geometry, but it needs also rest mass. Phenomenon of increasing of relativistic mass with speed can be used for a gradual transition from Newtonian mechanics to SR. It also shows how relativistic energy can have properties of matter. The postulates, which are used for the definition of SR, are therefore still clearer and the whole derivation of the Lorentz transformation is clearer.

<div class='abstract'>As the particles originating from point-like entities are associated with infinite self energies, a postulate, that the scalar-potential associated with particles are bounded by the Planck scale potential is presented. By defining the self-energy of a particle in terms of its scalar-potential, equivalences between charge-energy and mass-energy are obtained. The electromagnetic energy-momentum equation and de-Broglie's electromagnetic wave-length and frequency associated with a charge particle in motion are derived. Relativistically covariant electromagnetic energy and momentum expressions are obtained, resolving the 4/3 discrepancy. The non-covariance nature of the present classical electrodynamics is discussed and how the proposed postulate makes it a fully covariant theorem with the rest of the classical electrodynamics is presented. How the electromagnetic energy-momentum equation could potentially resolve the stability-problem of a charge particle is discussed and thereby a theoretical explanation to electron's spin is presented.</div>

<div class='title'>A New Crucial Experiment for Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_zins">Steven Zins</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Dayton Miller performed an experiment in 1925-1926 that, at face value, contradicted relativity theory. The strongest argument against Miller's experiment is that subsequent Michelson-Morley experiments yielded increasing consistency with relativity, disagreeing with Miller's results. But subsequent experiments were not valid replications of Miller's. Specifically, they failed to replicate the medium in the light path and the scale of Miller's experiment. A valid replication must either be exact or be demonstrably equivalent with regard to its crucial sensing region. The unexplained effects seen by Miller demand exact replication. The proposed experiment is crucial for special relativity but is more than a replication of Miller. This proposed Crucial Experiment should use a Michelson-Morley apparatus with a 4.25 m arm length as Miller used. The novelty of this experiment is that the light path should be in a chamber that can be operated from near zero to one atmosphere. Predictions: (1) At one atmosphere, the result will agree with Miller's and contradict relativity. (2) Near zero atmospheres, the result will agree with Georg Joos' and agree with relativity. (3) Intermediate pressures will yield intermediate results.</div>

<div class='abstract'>There has been a renewed interest in the recent years in the possibility of deviations from the predictionsof Newton&#8217;s &#8220;inverse-square law&#8221; of universal gravitation.One of the reasons for renewing this interest lies in various theoretical attempts to construct a unified elementary particle theory, in which there is a natural prediction of new forces over macroscopic distances. Therefore the existence of such a force would only coexist with gravity, and in principle could only be detected as a deviation from the inverse square law, or in the &#8220;universality of free fall&#8221; experiments.New experimental techniques such that of Sagnac interferometry can help explore the range of the Yukawa correction &#955; &#8805; 10^14 m where such forces might be present. It may be,that future space missions might be operating in this range which has been unexplored for very long time. To study the effect of the Yukawa correction to the gravitational potential and its corresponding signal delay in the vicinity of the Sun, we use a spherically symmetric modified space time metric where the Yukawa correction its added to the gravitational potential. Next, the Yukawa correction contribution to the signal delay is evaluated. In the case where the distance of closest approach is much less than the range &#955;, it results to a signal time delay that satisfies the relation t (b &lt;&#955;)&#8764;=37.7t (b = &#955;).</div>

<div class='title'>Rethinking Einstein's Rotation Analogy</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_j_benish">Richard J. Benish</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Einstein built general relativity (GR) on the foundation of special relativity (SR) with the help of an analogy involving uniformly rotating bodies. Among this analogy's most useful implications are those concerning the need for non-Euclidean geometry. Although GR is well-supported by observations, a curious fact is that almost all of them are of phenomena over the surfaces of large gravitating bodies; i.e., they support the &lt;i&gt;exterior&lt;/i&gt; solution. Whereas the &lt;i&gt;interior&lt;/i&gt; solution remains untested. In particular, the prediction that the rate of a clock at the center of a gravitating body is a local minimum remains untested. The Newtonian counterpart for this prediction of GR is the common oscillation prediction for a test mass dropped into a hole through a larger gravitating body. The main point in what follows is that this prediction needs to be checked by direct observation. Einstein's analogy serves as a launching pad for bringing out the significance of this experiment as well as exposing possible weaknesses in a few other assumptions, which are then also duly questioned. To facilitate looking upon these problems with fresh eyes, we invoke an imaginary civilization whose members know a lot about rotation but nothing about gravity. Their home is a large and remote rotating body whose mass is too small to make gravitational effects easily noticeable. What would these people think of Einstein's rotation analogy?</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. However as stated by both Alcubierre and Natario themselves the warp drive violates all the known energy conditions because the stress energy momentum tensor is negative implying in a negative energy density. While from a classical point of view the negative energy is forbidden the Quantum Field Theory allows the existence of very small amounts of it being the Casimir effect a good example as stated by Alcubierre himself.The major drawback concerning negative energies for the warp drive is the huge amount of negative energy able to sustain the warp bubble.Ford and Pfenning computed the amount of negative energy needed to maintain an Alcubierre warp drive and they arrived at the result of $10$ times the mass of the entire Universe for a stable warp drive configuration rendering the warp drive impossible.However Harold White manipulating the parameter $@$ in the original shape function that defines the Alcubierre spacetime demonstrated that it is possible to low these energy density requirements.We repeat here the Harold White analysis for the Natario spacetime and we arrive at similar conclusions.From $10$ times the mass of the Universe we also manipulated the parameter $@$ in the original shape function that defines the Natario spacetime and we arrived at a result of $10$ billion tons of negative mass to maintain a warp drive moving with a speed $200$ times faster than light.Our result is still a huge number about the weight of the Everest Mountain but at least it is better than the original Ford-Pfenning result of $10$ times the mass of the Universe.The main reason of this work is to demonstrate that Harold White point of view is entirely correct.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The purpose of our study is to understand the mathematical origin in real space of modulated and damped sinusoidal peaks observed in cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropies. We use the theory of the Fourier transform to connect localized features of the two-point correlation function in real space to oscillations in the power spectrum. We also illustrate analytically and by means of Monte Carlo simulations the angular correlation function for distributions of filled disks with fixed or variable radii capable of generating oscillations in the power spectrum. While the power spectrum shows repeated information in the form of multiple peaks and oscillations, the angular correlation function offers a more compact presentation that condenses all the information of the multiple peaks into a localized real space feature. We have seen that oscillations in the power spectrum arise when there is a discontinuity in a given derivative of the angular correlation function at a given angular distance. These kinds of discontinuities do not need to be abrupt in an infinitesimal range of angular distances but may also be smooth, and can be generated by simply distributing excesses of antenna temperature in filled disks of fixed or variable radii on the sky, provided that there is a non-null minimum radius and/or the maximum radius is constrained.</div>

We repeated the QI analysis of Ford and Pfenning for the Natario warp drive using the same Planck Length Scale but with a shape function that although different from the function choosed by Ford and Pfenning it obeys Natario requirements and because the Natario warp drive have a very different distribution of negative energy when compared to its Alcubierre counterpart this affects the QI analysis.We arrived at a sampling time that can last longer than $10^{-33}$ seconds enough to sustain a warp bubble for the interstellar travel mentioned above.We also computed the total negative energy requirements for the Natario warp drive and we arrived at a comfortable result.This leads us to conclude that the Natario warp drive is a valid solution of the Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity physically accessible for interstellar spaceflight.

<div class='abstract'>Based on the work of Jacobson [1] and Gibbons, [2] Schiller [3] has shown not only that a &lt;i&gt;maximum force&lt;/i&gt; follows from general relativity, but that general relativity can be &lt;i&gt;derived&lt;/i&gt; from the principle of maximum force. In the present paper an alternative derivation of maximum force is given. Inspired by the equivalence principle, the approach is based on a modification of the well known special relativity equation for the velocity acquired from uniform proper acceleration. Though in Schiller's derivation the existence of gravitational &lt;i&gt;horizons&lt;/i&gt; plays a key role, in the present derivation this is not the case. In fact, though the kinematic equation that we start with does exhibit a horizon, it is not carried over to its gravitational counterpart.

<div class='abstract'>Dark Energy is yet to be predicted by any model that stands out in its simplicity as an obvious choice for unified investigative effort. It is widely accepted that a new paradigm is needed to unify the standard cosmological model (SCM) and the minimal standard model (MSM). The purpose of this article is to construct a modified cosmological model (MCM) that predicts dark energy and contains this unity. Following the program of Penrose, geometry rather than differential equations will be the mathematical tool. Analytical methods from loop quantum cosmology (LQC) are examined in the context of the Poincar&#180;e conjecture. The longstanding problem of an external time with which to evolve quantum gravity is resolved. The supernovae and WMAP data are reexamined in this framework. No exotic particles or changes to General Relativity are introduced. The MCM predicts dark energy even in its Newtonian limit while preserving all observational results. In its General Relativistic limit, the MCM describes dark energy as an inverse radial spaghettification process. Observable predictions for the MCM are offered. AdS/CFT correspondence is discussed. The MCM is the 10 dimensional union of de Sitter and anti-de Sitter space and has M-theoretical application to the five string theories which lack a unifying conceptual component. This component unifies gravitation and electromagnetism.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dimitar_valev">Dimitar Valev</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Three mass dimension quantities have been derived by dimensional analysis by means of fundamental constants &#8211; the speed of light in vacuum (c), the gravitational constant (G), the Planck constant (h_bar) and the Hubble constant (H). The extremely small mass m1 ~ (h_bar*H)/c^2 ~ 10^(-33) eV has been identified with the Hubble mass mH, which seems close to the graviton mass mG. The enormous mass m2 ~ c^3/(G*H) ~ 10^53 kg is close to the mass of the Hubble sphere and practically coincides with the Hoyle-Carvalho formula for the mass of the observable universe. The third mass m3 ~ [(H*h_bar^3)/G^2]^(1/5) ~ 10^7 GeV could not be unambiguously identified at present time. Besides, it has been found remarkable fact that the Planck mass mPl ~ Sqrt [(h_bar*c)/G] appears geometric mean of the extreme masses m1 and m2. Finally, the substantial large number N = Sqrt [c^5/(2*G*h_bar*H^2) &#8776; 5.73&#215;10^60 has been derived relating cosmological parameters (mass, density, age and size of the observable universe) and fundamental microscopic properties of the matter (Planck units and Hubble mass). Thus, a precise formulation and proof of Large Numbers Hypothesis (LNH) has been found.</div>

<div class='abstract'>How much do we really know about gravity? Though our knowledge is sufficient to send people to the Moon, there is a large and fundamental gap in our empirical data; and there are basic questions about gravity that are rarely even asked, and so remain unanswered. The gap concerns the falling of test objects near the centers of larger gravitating bodies. Newton's theory of gravity and Einstein's theory, General Relativity, though giving essentially the same answers, describe the problem quite differently. A discussion of this difference--which emphasizes the role of &lt;i&gt;clock rates&lt;/i&gt; in Einstein's theory--evokes a question concerning the most basic characteristic of any theory of gravity: Is the motion due to gravity primarily downward or upward; i.e., inward or outward? Have our accepted theories of gravity determined this direction correctly? The answer to this question may seem obvious. We will find, however, that we don't really know. And most importantly, it is emphasized that we can get an unequivocal answer by performing a relatively simple laboratory experiment.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this short paper the noncommutative geometry and quantization of branes and the AdS is discussed. The question in part addresses an open problem left by this author in [1] on how branes are generated by stringy physics. The breaking of an open type I string into two strings generates a nascent brane at the new endpoints with inflationary cosmologies. This was left as a conjecture at the end of this paper on the role of quantum critical points in the onset of inflationary cosmology. The noncommutative geometry of the clock and lapse functions for the AdS-brane are derived as is the number of degrees of freedom which appear. The role of the AdS spacetime, or in particular its boundary, in cosmology is discussed in an elementary regularization scheme of the cosmological constant on the boundary. This is compared to schemes of conformal compactification of the AdS spacetime and the Heisenberg group.</div>

Cosmic initial conditions can be addressed with the Planck mass(Mp) and the coulomb mass(MC). Based on the Mach's principle and the characteristic Hubble mass (M0) of the present universe, it is noticed that, in the Hubble volume, critical density, observed matter density and the thermal energy density are in geometric series and the geometric ratio is 1 + ln (M0/MC) : In this connection, it can be suggested that - in understanding the basics of grand unication and cosmology, cosmic Hubble volume can be given a chance.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In modern cosmology, the shape of the universe is flat. In between the closed space and at space, there is one compromise. That is `Hubble volume'. Note that Hubble volume is only a theoretical and spherical expanding volume and is virtual. From Hubble volume one can estimate the Hubble mass. By coupling the Hubble mass with the Mach's principle, one can understand the origin of cosmic and atomic physical parameters. Considering the Mach's principle and the Hubble mass, in this paper an attempt is made to understand the origin of the strong and electromagnetic interactions.</div>

<div class='title'>The Analysis of Mcmonigal,lewis and O'byrne Applied to the Natario Warp Drive Spacetime</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein field equations that allows superluminal travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre warp drive discovered in $1994$ and the Natario warp drive discovered in $2001$. Recently McMonigal,Lewis and O&#180;Byrne presented an important analysis for the Alcubierre warp drive:A warp drive ship at superluminal speeds in interstellar space would trap in the warp bubble all the particles and radiations the ship encounters in its pathway and these trapped bodies would achieve immense energies due to the bubble superluminal speed.As far the ship goes by in interstellar space, more and more particles and radiations are trapped in the bubble generating in front of it a blanket with extremely large amounts of positive energy. The physical consequences of having this blanket of positive energies with enormous magnitudes in front of the negative energy of the warp bubble are still unknown. When the ship finishes the trip it stops suddenly releasing in a highly energetic burst all the trapped particles and radiations contained in the blanket damaging severely the destination point. In this work,we reproduce the same analysis for the Natario warp drive however using different mathematical arguments more accessible to beginners or intermediate students and we arrived exactly to the same conclusions. While in a long-term future some of the physical problems associated to the warp drive science(negative energy,Horizons) seems to have solutions(better shape functions for the negative energy problem and a theory that encompasses both General Relativity and non local quantum entanglements of Quantum Mechanics for the Horizons problem) and we discuss these solutions in our work,the analysis of McMonigal,Lewis and O&#180;Byrne although entirely correct do not have a foreseeable solution and remains the most serious obstacle against the warp drive as a physical reality</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this document we analyze the thought experiment proposed by Baxter. Baxter's conclusion is that his thought experiment shows a contradiction and that therefore relativity is wrong. However, we shall show that there is no contradiction and that eventually Baxter has misinterpreted relativity. As Baxter in his thought experiment makes use of the relativistic light-clock, we start with an analysis of the relativistic light-clock. The relativistic light-clock eventually implies relations between time-intervals, but also between distances, where a distinction is made between parallel distances and orthogonal distances, with respect to the velocity of the moving distance. Correct implementation of the relativistic light-clock shows that Baxter's thought experiment does not lead to contradictions. Baxter's contradiction is based on misinterpretation of relativity by Baxter himself, i.e. he has not shown any contradiction.</div>

<div class='title'>Four Poission-Laplace Theory of Gravitation (I)</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/golden_gadzirayi_nyambuya">G. G. Nyambuya</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Poisson-Laplace equation is a working and acceptable equation of gravitation which is mostly used or applied in its differential form in Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) modelling. From a general relativistic standpoint, it describes gravitational fields in the region of low spacetime curvature as it emerges in the weak field limit. For none-static gravitational fields, this equation is not generally covariant. On the requirements of general covariance, this equation can be extended to include a time dependent component, in which case, one is led to the Four Poisson-Laplace equation. We solve the Four Poisson-Laplace equation for radial solutions, and apart from the Newtonian gravitational pole, we obtain four new solutions leading to four new gravitational poles capable (in-principle) of explaining e.g. the rotation curves of galaxies, the Pioneer anomaly, the Titius-Bode Law and the formation of planetary rings. In this letter, we focus only on writing down these solutions. The task to show that these new solutions might explain the aforesaid gravitational anomalies, has been left for separate future readings.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Based on the big bang concepts- in the expanding universe, &#8216;rate of decrease in CMBR temperature&#8217; is a measure of the cosmic &#8216;rate of expansion&#8217;. Modern standard cosmology is based on two contradictory statements. They are - present CMBR temperature is isotropic and the present universe is accelerating. In particle physics also, till today laboratory evidence for the existence of &#8216;dark matter&#8217; and &#8216;dark energy&#8217; is very poor. Recent observations and thoughts supports the existence of the &#8216;cosmic axis of evil&#8217;. Independent of the cosmic red shift and CMBR observations, cosmic acceleration can be verified by measuring the `rate of decrease' in the fine structure ratio. In this connection an attempt is made to study the universe with a closed and growing model of cosmology. If the primordial universe is a natural setting for the creation of black holes and other non-perturbative gravitational entities, it is also possible to assume that throughout its journey, the whole universe is a primordial (growing and rotating) cosmic black hole. Instead of the Planck scale, initial conditions can be represented with the Coulomb scale. Obtained value of the present Hubble constant is close to 70.75 Km/sec/Mpc.</div>

<div class='title'>Two Theories of Special Relativity ?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/elemer_e_rosingr">Elemer E Rosingr</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recently, [3], it was shown that Special Relativity is in fact based just about on one single physical axiom which is that of Reciprocity. Originally, Einstein, [1], established Special Relativity on two physical axioms, namely, the Galilean Relativity and the Constancy of the Speed of Light in inertial reference frames. Soon after, [2,4,5], it was shown that the Galilean Relativity alone, together with some implicit mathematical type conditions, is sufficient for Special Relativity. The references in [7,3] can give an idea about the persistence over the years, even if not the popularity, of the issue of minimal axiomatic foundation of Special Relativity. Here it is important to note that, implicitly, three more assumptions have been used on space-time co-ordinate transformations, namely, the homogeneity of space-time, the isotropy of space, and certain mathematical condition of smoothness type on the coordinate transformations. In [3], a weaker boundedness type condition on space-time coordinate transformations is used instead of the usual mathematical smoothness type conditions. In this paper it is shown that the respective boundedness condition is related to the Principle of Local Transformation Increment Ratio Limitation, or in short, PLTIRL, a principle introduced here, and one which has an obvious physical meaning. It is also shown that PLTIRL is not a stronger assumption than that of the mentioned boundedness in [3], and yet it can also deliver the Lorentz Transformations. Of interest is the fact that, by formulating PLTIRL as a physical axiom, the possibility is opened up for the acceptance, or on the contrary, rejection of this physical axiom PLTIRL, thus leading to two possible theories of Special Relativity. And to add further likelihood to such a possibility, the rejection of PLTIRL leads easily to effects which involve unlimited time and/or space intervals, thus are not accessible to usual experimentation for the verication of their validity, or otherwise. A conclusion is that a more careful consideration of the assumptions underlying Special Relativity is worth pursuing. In this regard, a corresponding trend has lately been observable in Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. In the former, the respective analysis is more involved than has so far been the case for Special Relativity. As for the latter, the technical and conceptual diffculties are considerable. Regarding Quantum Field Theory, the situation is, so far, unique in Physics since, to start with, there is not even one single known rigorous and comprehensive enough mathematical model. This paper is a new version of [20].</div>

<div class='title'>Space Doesn't Expand. New Proof of Hubble's Law and Center of the Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>After the expansion of universe was observed in the 1920s, physicists and astronomers introduced the concept of ``space expands&quot; into physics and many observations and research results were used based on this. However, we can't explain why space expands and why it has a specific velocity and is no observations of expansion of space. This study proves that the expansion of the universe and Hubble's law doesn't result from the expansion of space, but is a dynamical result from the movement of galaxies in space. We could confirm that Hubble's law was always valid when the effect of acceleration was smaller than initial velocity. We can define the center of the universe and find it. There is a possibility that 2.7K background radiation is not radiation in the early days of the universe. In that case, we can't estimate that our universe is isotropic and uniform from CMBR. Also, this shows that cosmological redshift comes out from the Doppler effect of light. Expansion of space was explained that it was related to redshift and scale factor. Therefore, it is influencing many areas of astronomy and cosmology. Therefore, if this discovery is true, all matters related to redshift and scale factor should be reviewed.</div>

<div class='title'>General Relativity as Geometrical Approximation to a Field Theory of Gravity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/juan_ramon_gonzalez_alvarez">Juan Ram&#243;n Gonz&#225;lez &#193;lvarez</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is broadly believed that general relativity --a geometric theory-- is fully equivalent to the field theory of a massless, self-interacting, spin-2 field. This belief is reinforced by statements in many textbooks. However, an increasing criticism to this belief has been published. To settle this old debate about the precise physical nature of gravitation, this author introduces a simple but exact argument --based in the equivalence principle-- that shows that general relativity is not equivalent to a field theory of gravity. Subsequently, both the general relativistic Lagrangian for a particle and the Hilbert & Einstein equations are obtained as an approximation from a field theory of gravity, somehow as geometric optics can be derived from physical optics. The approximations involved in the geometrization are two: (i) the neglect of $T_{grav}^{\mu\nu}$ and $T_{int}^{\mu\nu}$ in the field-theoretic tensor $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ and (ii) the approximation of the effective metric by the curved spacetime metric $g_{\mu\nu} = \hat{g}_{\mu\nu} + O(h_{\mu\nu}^2)$. Further discussion of this derivation and of the approximations involved is given. Several misunderstandings about the consistency and observability of the flat spacetime theories of gravity are corrected. A detailed analysis of the fundamental differences between geometric and field-theoretic expressions reveals that all the well-known deficiencies of general relativity --including the impossibility to obtain a consistent quantum general relativity-- are direct consequences of the geometrization of the gravitational interaction. Finally, remarks about the status of dark matter are given, from the perspective of a generalized theory of gravity.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We investigate the twin paradox assuming the acceleration acts instantaneously in one of the twins and whose effect is just to revert the relative movement of the twins keeping the same relative speed. The relative motion of the twins is then split in two stages: one where they move away and another when they approach each other. Each stage is described by specific Lorentz transformations that obey certain boundary conditions related to the reversion of motion. We then show how the paradox arises from the particular form of the Lorentz transformation describing the approaching movement of the twins.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In my papers \cite{Assis1} and \cite{Assis2}, I obtain a Cold Big Bang Cosmology, fitting the cosmological data, with an absolute zero primordial temperature, a natural cutoff for the cosmological data to a vanishingly small entropy at a singular microstate of a comoving domain of the cosmological fluid. Now, in this brief paper, we show the energy density of the $t$-sliced universe must actually be the critical one, following as consequence of the solution in \cite{Assis1} and \cite{Assis2}. It must be pointed out that the result obtained here in this paper on the flatness problem does not contradict the solution in \cite{Assis1}, viz., does not contradict the open universe, with $k=-1$, obtained in \cite{Assis1}, since the solution in \cite{Assis1} had negative pressure and negative total cosmological energy density, hence lesser that the critical positive density. The critical density we obtain here is due to the positive fluctuations I previously discussed regarding the Heisenberg mechanism in \cite{Assis2}. Hence, the energy density due to fluctuation turns out to be positive, the critical one, this being calculated in \cite{Assis2} from the fluctuations within the $t$-sliced spherical shell at its $t$-sliced hypersurface, being the total energy density that generates the fluctuations, actually, negative in \cite{Assis1} and \cite{Assis2}, hence, again, lesser than the critical one and supporting $k=-1$. These results are complementary and support my previous results.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The history of the modern measurements of absolute motion has a long - more than century beginning from Michelson-Morley 1887. The earliest measurements assumed aether hypothesis. Cahill identifies the velocity as a velocity with respect to some preferred rest frame and uses relativistic kinematics although he misleadingly uses the terms absolute velocity and aether. The preferred frame could galaxy, or the system defining rest system in cosmology. It would be easy to dismiss this kind of experiments as attempts to return to the days before Einstein but this is not the case. It might be possible to gain unexpected information by this kind of measurements. Already the analysis of CMB spectrum demonstrated that Earth is not at rest in the Robertson-Walker coordinate system used to analysis CMB data and similar motion with respect to galaxy is quite possible and might serve as a rich source of information also in GRT based theory. In TGD framework the situation is especially interesting since sub-manifold gravity implies that maximal signal velocity depends on the space-time sheet and this effect might show itself in Mickelson-Morley type experiments. Also the motion of space-time sheets with respect to each other might be detectable.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The comparison of TGD with inflationary cosmology combined with new results about TGD inspired cosmology provides fresh insights to the relationship of TGD and standard approach and shows how TGD cures the lethal diseases of the eternal inflation. Very roughly: the replacement of the energy of the scalar field with magnetic energy replaces eternal inflation with a fractal quantum critical cosmology allowing to see more sharply the TGD counterpart of inflation and accelerating expansion as special cases of criticality. The rapid expansion periods correspond to phase transitions increasing the value of Planck constant and increasing the radius of magnetic flux tubes. This liberates magnetic energy and gives rise to radiation in turn giving rise to radiation and matter in the recent Universe just like the energy of inflaton field would give rise to radiation at the end of the inflation period in cosmic inflation. The multiverse of inflationary scenarios is replaced with the many-sheeted space-time and one can say that the laws of physics are essentially same everywhere in the sense that the fundamental symmetries are the symmetries of standard model everywhere.</div>

<div class='title'>On Point Mass Sources, Null Naked Singularities and Euclidean Gravitational Action as Entropy</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is rigorously shown how the static spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations can furnish a $null$ naked singularity associated with a point mass source at $ r = 0$. The construction relies in the possibility of having a metric $discontinuity$ at the location of the point mass. This result should be contrasted with the spacelike singularity described by the textbook black hole solution. It has been argued by some authors why one cannot get any information from the null naked singularity so it will not have any undesirable physical effect to an outside far away observer and cannot cause a breakdown of predictability. In this way one may preserve the essence of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. The field equations due to a delta-function point-mass source at $ r = 0 $ are solved and the Euclidean gravitational action (in $ \hbar $ units) corresponding to those solutions is evaluated explicitly. It is found that it is precisely equal to the black hole entropy (in Planck area units). This result holds in any dimensions $ D \ge 3 $. We finalize by arguing why the Noncommutative Gravity of the spacetime tangent (co-tangent) bundle is the proper arena to study point masses.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper we build a counterexample that raises a fundamental distinction between recession movement of matter and space expansion. We prove that observing matter recession at an accelerating rate is not an indication for the acceleration of the universe expansion. More precisely, we show that the observed acceleration in the recession movement of galaxies is naturally due to a universe deceleration. The counterexample provides us with a possible space with independent movement that might produce the observed behavior of galaxies registered for the redshift $z&lt;0.5$ as well as for the redshift $z&gt;0.5$. This counterexample calls into question the recent interpretation of the accelerating recession movement of galaxies as a sign of universe acceleration.</div>

<div class='title'>General Relativity and Holographic Conjecture Tangles with Quantum Mechanics and Sub Quantum Theories :New Insights and Interpretations About Strings and Quantization with Cosmological Significance</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/sourish_kumar_maitra">Sourish kumar Maitra</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>General relativity and various possibilities about its proper combination with Quantum mechanics is a central topic in theoretical physics. In this article we explain various links which bridge between different views about Quantum Gravity theories. It turns out that these have very close relation with different interpretations about what quantization mean.We try to justify basic questions like what a string tension mean. First, we start with qualitative analysis and then we confirm these with quantitative results. These are shown to have relation with Quantum Gravity noise, Dark Energy, Hogan&apos;s noise and the Holographic principle. We clarify a long standing confusion in entropic Gravity, whether increase in entropy ($\triangle s$) makes the particle to move ($\triangle x$) or vice-versa. We indicate the possibility about non-local entanglement operation carried out by space-time which will increase entropy and a particle in space will move causing $\triangle x$. We relate noise with dissipation, much like a statistical system. In this context, we discuss the hierarchy issue. We try to see string as a natural consequence of intrinsic computation in space-time in planck scale. We clarify that although we talk about dissipative sub-quantum models, as quantization track only equivalence class (according to T&apos;Hooft), it does not contradict with information conservations in quantum mechanics; equivalence class informations are conserved. We try to describe why we can attach entropy to an arbitrary spatial surface ( like a black hole horizon) and can derive Einstein&apos;s equation as the second law of thermodynamics.</div>

<div class='title'>TGD Inspired Vision About Entropic Gravitation</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&auml;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>&lt;p&gt; Entropic gravity (EG) introduced by Verlinde has stimulated a great interest. One of the most interesting reactions is the commentary of Sabine Hossenfelder. The article of Kobakhidze relies on experiments supporting the existence of Schr&ouml;dinger amplitudes of neutron in the gravitational field of Earth develops an argument suggesting that EG hypothesis in the form in which it excludes gravitons is wrong. Indeed, the mere existence of gravitational bound states suggests strongly the existence of transitions between them by graviton emission. The following arguments represent TGD inspired view about what entropic gravity (EG) could be if one throws out the unnecessary assumptions such as the emerging dimensions and absence of gravitons. Also the GRT limit of TGD is discussed leading to rather strong implications concerning the TGD counterparts of blackholes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;OL&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;LI&gt; If one does not believe in TGD, one could start from the idea that stochastic quantization"&gt;stochastic quantization or something analogous to it might imply something analogous to entropic gravity (EG). What is required is the replacement of the path integral with functional integral. More precisely, one has functional integral in which the real contribution to K&auml;hler action of the preferred extremal from Euclidian regions of the space-time surface to the exponent represents K&auml;hler function and the imaginary contribution from Minkowskian regions serves as a Morse function so that the counterpart of Morse theory in WCW is obtained on stationary phase approximation in accordance with the vision about TGD as almost topological QFT. The exponent of K&auml;hler function is the new element making the functional integral well-defined and the presence of phase factor gives rise to the interference effects characteristic for quantum field theories although one does not integrate over all space-time surfaces. In zero energy ontology one has however pairs of 3-surfaces at the opposite light-like boundaries of CD so that something very much analogous to path integral is obtained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Holography requires that everything reduces to the level of 3-metrics and more generally, to the level of 3-D field configurations. Something like this happens if one can approximate path integral integral with the integral over small deformations for the minima of the action. This also happens in completely integral quantum field theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The basic vision behind quantum TGD is that this approximation is much nearer to reality than the original theory. In other words, holography is realized in the sense that to a given 3-surface the metric of WCW assigns a unique space-time and this space-time serves as the analog of Bohr orbit and allows to realize 4-D general coordinate invariance in the space of 3-surfaces so that classical theory becomes an exact part of quantum theory. This point of view will be adopted in the following also in the framework of general relativity where one considers abstract 4-geometries instead of 4-surfaces: functional integral should be over 3-geometries with the definition of K&auml;hler metric assigning to 3-geometry a unique 4-geometry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;LI&gt;A powerful constraint is that the functional integral is free of divergences. Both 4-D path integral and stochastic quantization for gravitation fail in this respect due to the local divergences (in super-gravity situation might be different). The TGD inspired approach reducing quantum TGD to almost topological QFT with Chern-Simons term and a constraint term depending on metric associated with preferred 3-surfaces allows to circumvent this difficulty. This picture will applied to the quantization of GRT and one could see the resulting theory as a guess for what GRT limit of TGD could be. The first guess that K&auml;hler function corresponds to Einstein-Maxwell action for this kind of preferred extremal turns out to be correct. An essential and radically new element of TGD is the possibility of space-time regions with Euclidian signature of the induced metric replacing the interiors of blackholes: this element will be assumed also now. The conditions that CP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents and extremal of EYM action requires cosmological constant in Euclidian regions determined by the constant curvature of CP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and one can ask whether the average value of cosmological constant over 3-space could correspond to the cosmological constant explaining accelerating cosmic expansion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Entropic gravity is generalized in TGD framework so that all interactions are entropic: the reason is that in zero energy ontology (ZEO) the S-matrix is replaced with M-matrix defining a square root of thermodynamics in a well defined sense. &lt;/OL&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</div>

<div class='title'>The Black Hole Catastrophe: A Short Reply to J. J. Sharples</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A recent Letter to the Editor (Sharples J. J., Coordinate transformations and metric extension: a rebuttal to the relativistic claims of Stephen J. Crothers, Progress in Physics, v.1, 2010) has analysed a number of my papers. Dr. Sharples has committed errors in both mathematics and physics. His notion that r = 0 in the so-called &#65533;Schwarzschild solution&#65533; marks the point at the centre of the related manifold is false, as is his related claim that Schwarzschild&#65533;s actual solution describes a manifold that is extendible. His post hoc introduction of Newtonian concepts and related mathematical expressions into the &#65533;Schwarzschild solution&#65533; is invalid; for instance, Newtonian two-body relations into what is alleged to be a one-body problem. Each of the objections are treated in turn and their invalidity fully demonstrated. Black hole theory is riddled with contradictions. This article provides definitive proof that black holes do not exist.</div>

<div class='title'>Question of Planck&#65533;s Constant in Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/joseph_f_messina">Joseph F. Messina</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recent astronomical observations have revealed important new clues regarding dark matter's behavior. However, the fact remains that all experimental efforts to detect dark matter directly, in a laboratory setting, have failed. A natural explanation for these failed efforts may be possible by postulating that dark matter's behavior is governed by a non-Planckian &quot;action.&quot; It is pointed out, as a preliminary to advancing this possibility, that no purely dark matter measurement of Planck's constant exists. The resulting hypothesis advocates the existence of a new, experimentally verifiable, dark matter candidate. An extension of this hypothesis to the cosmological realm suggests that dark matter may have come into existence 10 to the minus 44 seconds after the big bang; an order of magnitude prior to the Planck era.</div>

<div class='title'>On Superluminal Particles and the Extended Relativity Theories</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Superluminal particles are studied within the framework of the Extended Relativity theory in Clifford spaces (C-spaces). In the simplest scenario, it is found that it is the contribution of the Clifford scalar component &pi; of the poly-vector-valued momentum which is responsible for the superluminal behavior in ordinary spacetime due to the fact that the effective mass M = (see paper) is imaginary (tachyonic). However, from the point of view of C-space, there is no superluminal (tachyonic) behavior because the true physical mass still obeys M2 &gt; 0. Therefore, there are no violations of the Clifford-extended Lorentz invariance and the extended Relativity principle in C-spaces. Furthermore, to lowest order, there is no contribution of terms involving powers of the Planck mass (1/m2P ) indicating that quantum gravitational effects do not play a role at this order. A Born&#65533;s Reciprocal Relativity theory in Phase Spaces leads to modified dispersion relations involving both coordinates and momenta, and whose truncations furnish Lorentz-violating dispersion relations which appear in Finsler Geometry, rainbow-metrics models and Double (deformed) Special Relativity. These models also admit superluminal particles. A numerical analysis based on the recent OPERA experimental findings on alleged superluminal muon neutrinos is made. For the average muon neutrino energy of 17 Gev, we find a value for &pi; = 119.7 Mev that, coincidentally, is close to the mass of the muon m&lt;sub&gt;&mu;&lt;/sub&gt; = 105.7 Mev.</div>

<div class='title'>The Change of Gravitational Potential Energy and Dark Energy in the Zero Energy Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Gravity is the force conquering the structure of the universe. By recognizing the components of the universe, we are estimating the quantity of components composing the universe through size of gravity and gravitational potential energy (GPE). In this paper, it is being shown that the universe can be born and expanded through pair creation of positive energy (mass) and negative energy (mass) from zero energy condition. Also, GPE is composed by 3 units of U++, U--, and U-+ when negative and positive energy exists, U-+ (GPE between negative mass and positive mass) has positive values and is the component that makes repulsive gravitational effect. U-+ corresponds with the inner energy of the system and can be interpreted as dark energy. The force by U-+ is F = (4piG/3)k_h(t)M&#961;r = (1/3)&#923;(t)Mc^2r shaped. Also, situations in which U-+ has much higher value than |U--| + |U++| depending on the distribution of negative mass and positive mass is possible. This doesn't mean that 72.1% of dark energy independently exists, but means that explanation from GPE occurring from 4.6% of negative energy, which is the same as 4.6% of positive energy, is possible. Moreover, 4.6% of negative energy is the energy which is inevitably required from zero energy, which is the most natural total energy value in the universe. This discovery implies that our belief that size of gravitational effect and size of components of the universe would always 1:1 correspond was wrong. We set up each model from the birth of universe to the present, and calculated GPE using computer simulation in each level. As a result, we could verify that &#8220;pair creation model of negative mass and positive mass&#8221; explains inflation of the early universe and decelerating expansion, and present accelerating expansion in time series.</div>

His crucial result was modification of the Newtonian potential of universal gravitation due to a multiplicative constant equal to 4=3. However, this presentation has been stirred up my negative opinion. The controversy has been caused by absence of a lot of details, what have been made the talk manifestly misleading. The lecturer did not respond to my questions satisfactory. Mukhanov&#65533;s deductions are at most half-true, and they can be easily verified by straightforward calculations.

<div class='abstract'>In this brief paper, we solve the relativistic kinematics related to the intersection between a relativistic beam of particles (neutrinos, e.g.) and consecutive detectors. The gravitational eects are neglected, but the eect of the Earth rotation is taken into consideration under a simple approach in which we consider two instantaneous inertial reference frames in relation to the fixed stars: an instantaneous inertial frame of reference having got the instantaneous velocity of rotation (about the Earth axis of rotation) of the Cern at one side, the lab system of reference in which the beam propagates, and another instantaneous inertial system of reference having got the instantaneous velocity of rotation of the detectors at Gran Sasso at the other side, this latter being the system of reference of the detectors. Einstein&#65533;s relativity theory provides a velocity of intersection between the beam and the detectors greater than the velocity of light in the empty space as derived in this paper, in virtue of the Earth rotation. We provide a simple calculation for the discrepancy between a correct measure for the experiment and a measure arising due to the eect derived in this paper.</div>

<div class='title'>A Self-Similar Model of the Universe Unveils the Nature of Dark Energy</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alfredo_g_oliveira">Alfredo G. Oliveira</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This work presents a critical yet previously unnoticed property of the units of some constants, able of supporting a new, self-similar, model of the universe. This model displays a variation of scale with invariance of dimensionless parameters, a characteristic of self-similar phenomena displayed by cosmic data. The model is deducted from two observational results (expansion of space and invariance of constants) and has just one parameter, the Hubble parameter. Somewhat surprisingly, classic physical laws hold both in standard and comoving units, except for a small new term in the angular momentum law that is beyond present possibilities of direct measurement. In spite of having just one parameter, the model is as successful as the &Lambda;CDM model in the classic cosmic tests, and a value of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 64 kms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;Mpc&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained from the fitting with supernovae Ia data from Union compilation. It is shown that in standard units the model corresponds to Big Bang cosmologies, namely to the &Lambda;CDM model, unveiling what dark energy stands for. This scaling (dilation) model is a one-parameter model that seems able of fitting cosmic data, that does not conflict with fundamental physical laws and that is not dependent on hypotheses, being straightforwardly deducted from the two observational results above mentioned.</div>

This solution resides on a negative pressure solution from the general relativity field equation and on a postulate regarding a Heisenberg indeterminacy mechanism related to the energy fluctuation obtained from the solution of the field equations under the Robertson-Walker comoving elementar line element context in virtue of the adoption of the Cosmological Principle. In this paper, we see the, positive, dierential energy fluctuation, purely obtained from the general relativity cosmological solution in [3], leads to the quantum mechanical argument of the postulate in [3], provided this energy fluctuation is quantized, strongly supporting the postulate in [3].

<div class='abstract'>The purpose of this paper is to reconcile observations of dark matter effects on the galactic and cosmological scales with the null results of astroparticle physics observations such as CDMS and ANTARES. This paper will also provide a candidate unified and simpler mathematical formulation for the Lambda CDM model. Unification is achieved by a combination of the f(R) approach, with the standard LCDM approach and inflationary models. It is postulated that dark matter-energy fields depend on the Ricci curvature R. Standard methods of classical and quantum field theory on curved space time are applied. When this model is treated as a quantum field theory in curved space-time, the dark matter-dark matter fermion annihilation cross section grows as the square of the Ricci scalar. It is proposed and mathematically demonstrated that in this model dark matter particles could have shorter lifetimes in regions of relatively strong gravity such as near the sun, near the Earth, or any other large mass. The unexpected difficulties in directly observing fermionic particles of dark matter in Earth based observatories are explained by this theory. The gravitational field of the Sun and Earth may effect them in ways the standard WIMP models would never predict.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We solve the general relativity (GR) field equations under the cosmological scope via one extra postulate. The plausibility of the postulate resides within the Heisenberg indeterminacy principle, being heuristically analysed throughout the appendix. Under this approach, a negative energy density may provide the positive energy content of the universe via fluctuation, since the question of conservation of energy in cosmology is weakened, supported by the known lack of scope of the Noether's theorem in cosmology. The initial condition of the primordial universe turns out to have a natural cutoff such that the temperature of the cosmological substratum converges to the absolute zero, instead of the stablished divergence at the very beginning. The adopted postulate provides an explanation for the cosmological dark energy open question. The solution agrees with cosmological observations, including a 2.7K CMBT prediction.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper presents an analytical solution to the geometry of large rotating systems which reconciles the peculiar rotation profiles of distant galaxies with Einstein's principle of General Relativity. The resulting mathematical solution shows that large rotating systems are distorted in the space of a non-rotating observer into a spiral pattern with tangential velocities that behave in agreement with those observed in distant galaxies. This paper also demonstrates how the scale of the spiral structure of rotating systems can be used to determine its distance from the observer. The authors' proposed equations for the rotation prole and the distance measure are compared with the observed rotation proles and Cepheid distance measurements of several galaxies with strong agreement.

<div class='title'>Quantum Field Theory with Electric-Magnetic Duality and Spin-Mass Duality But Without Grand Unification and Supersymmetry</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/rainer_w_kuhne">Rainer W. K&uuml;hne</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>I present a generalization of quantum electrodynamics which includes Dirac magnetic monopoles and the Salam magnetic photon. This quantum electromagnetodynamics has many attractive features. (1) It explains the quantization of electric charge. (2) It describes symmetrized Maxwell equations. (3) It is manifestly covariant. (4) It describes local four-potentials. (5) It avoids the unphysical Dirac string. (6) It predicts a second kind of electromagnetic radiation which can be veried by a tabletop experiment. An eect of this radiation may have been observed by August Kundt in 1885. Furthermore I discuss a generalization of General Relativity which includes Cartan's torsion. I discuss the mathematical denition, concrete description, and physical meaning of Cartan's torsion. I argue that the electric-magnetic duality of quantum electromagnetodynamics is analogous to the spin-mass duality of Einstein-Cartan theory. A quantum version of this theory requires that the torsion tensor corresponds to a spin-3 boson called tordion which is shown to have a rest mass close to the Planck mass. Moreover I present an empirically satised fundamental equation of unied eld theory which includes the fundamental constants of electromagnetism and gravity. I conclude with the remark that the concepts presented here require neither Grand Unication nor supersymmetry.</div>

<div class='title'>Reduced Total Energy Requirements For The Original Alcubierre and Natario Warp Drive Spacetimes-The Role Of Warp Factors.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Warp Drives are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations that allows Superluminal Travel within the framework of General Relativity. There are at the present moment two known solutions: The Alcubierre Warp Drive discovered in 1994 and the Natario Warp Drive discovered in 2001. However as stated by both Alcubierre and Natario themselves the Warp Drive violates all the known energy conditions because the stress energy momentum tensor(the right side of the Einstein Field Equations) for the Einstein tensor G&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; is negative implying in a negative energy density. While from a classical point of view the negative energy is forbidden the quantum theory allows the existence of very small amounts of it being the Casimir effect a good example as stated by Alcubierre himself. But the stress energy momentum tensor of both Alcubierre and Natario Warp Drives have the speed of the ship raised to the square inside its mathematical structure which means to say that as fast the ship goes by then more and more amounts of negative energy are needed in order to maintain the Warp Drive. Since the total energy requirements to maintain the Warp Drive are enormous and since quantum theory only allows small amounts of it,many authors regarded the Warp Drive as unphysical and impossible to be achieved. We compute the negative energy density requirements for a Warp Bubble with a radius of 100 meters(large enough to contain a ship) moving with a speed of 200 times light speed(fast enough to reach stars at 20 light-years away in months not in years)and we verify that the negative energy density requirements are of about 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; times the positive energy density of Earth!!!(We multiply the mass of Earth by c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and divide by Earth volume for a radius of 6300km). However both Alcubierre and Natario Warp Drives as members of the same family of the Einstein Field Equations requires the so-called Shape Functions in order to be mathematically defined. We present in this work two new Shape Functions one for the Alcubierre and another for the NatarioWarp Drive Spacetimes that allows arbitrary Superluminal speeds while keeping the negative energy density at &#65533;low&#65533; and &#65533;affordable&#65533; levels.We do not violate any known law of quantum physics and we maintain the original geometries of both Alcubierre and Natario Warp Drive Spacetimes.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The notion of black holes voraciously gobbling up matter, twisting spacetime into contortions that trap light, stretching the unwary into long spaghetti-like strands as they fall inward to ultimately collide and merge with an infinitely dense point-mass singularity, has become a mantra of the astrophysical community. There are almost daily reports of scientists claiming that they have again found black holes again here and there. It is asserted that black holes range in size from micro to mini, to intermediate and on up through to supermassive behemoths and it is accepted as scientific fact that they have been detected at the centres of galaxies. Images of black holes interacting with surrounding matter are routinely included with reports of them. Some physicists even claim that black holes will be created in particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, potentially able to swallow the Earth, if care is not taken in their production. Yet contrary to the assertions of the astronomers and astrophysicists of the black hole community, nobody has ever found a black hole, anywhere, let alone imaged one. The pictures adduced to convince are actually either artistic impressions (i.e. drawings) or photos of otherwise unidentified objects imaged by telescopes and merely asserted to be due to black holes, ad hoc.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Although both Alcubierre and Natario Spacetimes belongs to the same family of Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity and both have many resemblances between each other ,the Energy Density distribution in the Alcubierre Warp Drive is different than the one found in the Natario Warp Drive.The Horizons will arise in both Spacetimes when approaching Superluminal(Warp) speeds however due to a different distribution of Energy Density the Natario Warp Drive behaves slightly different when compared to the Alcubierre one. The major differences between the Natario and Alcubierre Warp Drive Spacetimes occurs when we study the Infinite Doppler Blueshifts that affect the Alcubierre Spacetime but not affect the Natario one because while in Alcubierre Spacetime the Negative Energy is distributed in a toroidal region above and below the ship perpendicular to the direction of the motion while in front of the ship.the space is empty having nothing to prevent a photon to reach the Horizon because in this case the Horizon lies on empty space,in the Natario Spacetime the Energy Density is distributed in a spherical shell that covers the entire ship and a photon sent to the front will be deflected by this shell of Negative Energy before reaching the Horizon because the Horizon also lies inside this shell and not on &#65533;empty&#65533; space.This shell avoids the occurrence of Infinite Doppler Blueshifts in the Natario Warp Drive Spacetime.We examine in this work the major differences between both Natario and Alcubierre Spacetimes outlining the repulsive character of the Negative Energy Density.The creation of a Warp Bubble in Alcubierre or Natario Spacetimes is beyond the scope of Classical General Relativity and will have to wait until the arrival of a real Quantum Gravity theory that must encompass Superluminal Non-Local Quantum Entanglement Effects in order to deal with the Horizon problem added to the Geometrical features of Classical General Relativity plus it must also provide a way to generate large outputs of Negative Energy Densities.Since this theory is ahead of our scientific capabilities,we discuss in the end of this work an approach that could be performed by our science in a short period of term.to increase our knowledge about the Warp Drive as a Dynamical Spacetime.</div>

However, if you rotate your body then your arms are lifted up as the rotation is faster and faster. Mach principle is that the matter of the whole universe can affect local dynamic systems. That is, the matter of the whole universe sets up the local absolute reference frames. However, both the theories of general relativity and Big Bang are against the absolute reference frames of Mach Principle.

<div class='title'>How to Use the Cosmological Schwinger Principle for Energy Ux, Entropy, and "Atoms of Space-Time" to Create a Thermodynamic Space-Time and Multiverse</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/andrew_beckwith">Andrew Beckwith</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We make explicit an idea by Padmanabhan in DICE 2010 [1], as to finding "atoms of space{time" permitting a thermodynamic treatment of emergent structure similar to Gibbs treatment of statistical physics. That is, an ensemble of gravitons is used to give an "atom" of space-time congruent with relic GW. The idea is to reduce the number of independent variables to get a simple emergent space-time structure of entropy. An electric field, based upon the cosmological Schwinger principle, is linked to relic heat flux, with entropy production tied in with candidates as to infl aton potentials. The effective electric field links with the Schwinger 1951s result of an E field leading to pairs of e+e- charges nucleated in space-time volume V.t. Note that in most in flationary models, the assumption is for a magnetic field, not an electric field. An electric field permits a kink-anti-kink construction of an emergent structure, which includes Glinka's recent pioneering approach to a Multiverse. Also an E field allows for an emergent relic particle frequency range between one and 100 GHz. The novel contribution is a relic E field, instead of a B field, in relic space-time "atom" formation and vacuum nucleation of the same.</div>

Since r is in fact nothing more than a real-valued parameter for the actual radial quantities in the gravitational field, the standard interpretation is erroneous. Moreover, the true radial quantities lead inescapably to &lambda; = 0 so that, cosmologically, Einstein&#65533;s theory predicts an infinite, static, empty universe.</div>

<div class='title'>On Isotropic Coordinates and Einstein&#65533;s Gravitational Field</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is proved herein that the metric in the so-called &#65533;isotropic coordinates&#65533; for Einstein&#65533;s gravitational field is a particular case of an infinite class of equivalent metrics. Furthermore, the usual interpretation of the coordinates is erroneous, because in the usual form given in the literature, the alleged coordinate length (see paper) is not a coordinate length. This arises from the fact that the geometrical relations between the components of the metric tensor are invariant and therefore bear the same relations in the isotropic system as those of the metric in standard Schwarzschild coordinates.</div>

<div class='title'>The Black Hole Catastrophe And the Collapse of Spacetime</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The notion of black holes voraciously gobbling up matter, twisting spacetime into contortions that trap light, stretching the unwary into long spaghetti-like strands as they fall inward to ultimately collide and merge with an infinitely dense point-mass singularity, has become a mantra of the astrophysical community, so much so that even primaryschool children know about the sinister black hole. There are almost daily reports of scientists claiming that they have again found black holes here and there. It is asserted that black holes range in size from micro to mini, to intermediate and on up through to supermassive behemoths. Black holes are spoken of as scientific facts and it is routinely claimed that they have been detected at the centres of galaxies. Images of black holes having their wicked ways with surrounding matter are routinely included with reports of them. Some physicists even claim that black holes will be created in particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, potentially able to swallow the Earth. Despite the assertions of the astronomers and astrophysicists, nobody has ever found a black hole, anywhere, let alone &#65533;imaged&#65533; one. The pictures adduced to convince are actually either artistic impressions (i.e. drawings) or photos of otherwise unidentified objects imaged by telescopes and merely asserted to be due to black holes, ad hoc.</div>

<div class='title'>On Certain Conceptual Anomalies in Einstein&#65533;s Theory of Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>There are a number of conceptual anomalies occurring in the Standard exposition of Einstein&#65533;s Theory of Relativity. These anomalies relate to issues in both mathematics and in physics and penetrate to the very heart of Einstein&#65533;s theory. This paper reveals and amplifies a few such anomalies, including the fact that Einstein&#65533;s field equations for the so-called static vacuum configuration, R&lt;sub&gt;&mu;&nu;&lt;/sub&gt; =0, violates his Principle of Equivalence, and is therefore erroneous. This has a direct bearing on the usual concept of conservation of energy for the gravitational field and the conventional formulation for localisation of energy using Einstein&#65533;s pseudo-tensor. Misconceptions as to the relationship between Minkowski spacetime and Special Relativity are also discussed, along with their relationships to the pseudo-Riemannian metric manifold of Einstein&#65533;s gravitational field, and their fundamental geometric structures pertaining to spherical symmetry.</div>

<div class='title'>A Brief History of Black Holes</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Neither the layman nor the specialist, in general, have any knowledge of the historical circumstances underlying the genesis of the idea of the Black Hole. Essentially, almost all and sundry simply take for granted the unsubstantiated allegations of some ostentatious minority of the relativists. Unfortunately, that minority has been rather careless with the truth and is quite averse to having its claims corrected, notwithstanding the documentary evidence on the historical record. Furthermore, not a few of that vainglorious and disingenuous coterie, particularly amongst those of some notoriety, attempt to dismiss the testimony of the literature with contempt, and even deliberate falsehoods, claiming that history is of no importance. The historical record clearly demonstrates that the Black Hole has been conjured up by combination of confusion, superstition and ineptitude, and is sustained by widespread suppression of facts, both physical and theoretical. The following essay provides a brief but accurate account of events, verifiable by reference to the original papers, by which the scandalous manipulation of both scientific and public opinion is revealed.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The black hole, which arises solely from an incorrect analysis of the Hilbert solution, is based upon a misunderstanding of the significance of the coordinate radius r. This quantity is neither a coordinate nor a radius in the gravitational field and cannot of itself be used directly to determine features of the field from its metric. The appropriate quantities on the metric for the gravitational field are the proper radius and the curvature radius, both of which are functions of r. The variable r is actually a Euclidean parameter which is mapped to non-Euclidean quantities describing the gravitational field, namely, the proper radius and the curvature radius.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In a previous paper I derived the general solution for the simple point-mass in a true Schwarzschild space.

The general exact solution is proved regular everywhere except at the arbitrary location of the source of the gravitational field. In no case does the black hole manifest. The conventional solutions giving rise to various black holes are shown to be inconsistent with General Relativity.</div>

<div class='title'>Reasons for Relativistic Mass and Its Influence on Duff's Claims that Dimensionful Quantities Are Physically Nonexistent</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/janko_kokosar">J Koko&scaron;ar</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The main argument against the relativistic mass is that it does not tell us anything more than the total energy tells us, although it is not incorrect. It is shown that this is not true, because new aspects of special relativity (SR) can be noticed. One reason for this denition is to show a relation between time dilation and relativistic mass. This relation can be further used to present a connection between space-time and matter more clearly, and to show that space-time does not exist without matter. This means a simpler presentation than is shown with Einstein's general covariance. Therefore, this opposes that SR is only a theory of space-time geometry. Phenomenon of increasing of relativistic mass with speed can be used for a gradual transition from Newtonian mechanics to SR. The postulates, which are used for the denition of SR, are therefore still clearer and the total derivation of the Lorentz transformation is clearer. Such derivation also gives a more realistic example for the debate regarding Du's claims. It gives also some counter-arguments for some details of debate about physical nonexistence of dimensionful units and quantities. These details are why three elementary units exist and why a direct physical measurement is not the only possibility for physical existence. Such derivation thus shows that relativistic mass is dierently presented to us as relativistic energy.</div>

<div class='title'>The Black Hole Catastrophe: A Reply to J. J. Sharples</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_j_crothers">Stephen J. Crothers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A recent Letter to the Editor (Sharples J. J., Coordinate transformations and metric extension: a rebuttal to the relativistic claims of Stephen J. Crothers, Progress in Physics, v.1, 2010) has analysed a number of my publications in Progress in Physics. There are serious problems with this treatment which should be brought to the attention of the Journal's readership. Dr. Sharples has committed errors in both mathematics and physics. For instance, his notion that r = 0 in the so-called &quot;Schwarzschild solution&quot; marks the point at the centre of the related manifold is false, as is his related claim that Schwarzschild's actual solution describes a manifold that is extendible. His post hoc introduction of Newtonian concepts and related mathematical expressions into Schwarzschild's actual solution are invalid; for instance, Newtonian two-body relations into what is alleged to be a one-body problem. Each of the objections are treated in turn and their invalidity fully demonstrated. Black hole theory is riddled with contradictions. This article provides definitive proof that black holes do not exist.</div>

Le livre propose une analyse physico-math&eacute;matique nouvelle en &eacute;laborant une th&eacute;orie des observables dans le cadre de la relativit&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale.

Les m&eacute;thodes d'analyse covariante alors en vigueur depuis le milieu des ann&eacute;es 30 ne prenaient pas encore en compte les concepts de quantit&eacute;s physiquement observables (grandeurs chronologiquement invariantes ou plus pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment grandeurs dites &quot;chronom&eacute;triques&quot;) de la relativit&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale.

<div class='abstract'>The re-identification of the many-world background of the special theory of relativity (SR) as four-world background in the first part of this paper (instead of two-wold background isolated in the initial papers), is concluded in this second part. The flat two-dimensional proper intrinsic spacetime, which underlies the flat four-dimensional proper spacetime in each universe, introduced as ansatz in the initial paper, is derived formally within the four-world picture. The identical magnitudes of masses, identical sizes and identical shapes of the four members of every quartet of symmetry-partner particles or objects in the four universes are shown. The immutability of Lorentz invariance on flat spacetime of SR in each of the four universes is shown to arise as a consequence of the perfect symmetry of relative motion at all times among the four members of every quartet of symmetry-partner particles and objects in the four universes. The The perfect symmetry of relative motions at all times, coupled with the identical magnitudes of masses, identical sizes and identical shapes, of the members of every quartet of symmetry-partner particles and objects in the four universes, guarantee perfect symmetry of state among the universes.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The pair of co-existing symmetrical universes, referred to as our (or positive) universe and negative universe, isolated and shown to constitute a two-world background for the special theory of relativity (SR) in previous papers, encompasses another pair of symmetrical universes, referred to as positive time-universe and negative time-universe. The Euclidean 3-spaces (in the context of SR) of the positive time-universe and the negative time-universe constitute the time dimensions of our (or positive) universe and the negative universe respectively, relative to observers in the Euclidean 3-spaces of our universe and the negative universe and the Euclidean 3-spaces of or our universe and the negative universe constitute the time dimensions of the positive time-universe and the negative time-universe respectively, relative to observers in the Euclidean 3-spaces of the positive time-universe and the negative time-universe. Thus time is a secondary concept derived from the concept of space according to this paper. The one-dimensional particle or object in time dimension to every three-dimensional particle or object in 3-space in our universe is a three-dimensional particle or object in 3-space in the positive time-universe. Perfect symmetry of natural laws is established among the resulting four universes and two outstanding issues about the new spacetime/intrinsic spacetime geometrical representation of Lorentz transformation/intrinsic Lorentz transformation in the two-world picture, developed in the previous papers, are resolved within the larger four-world picture in this first part of this paper.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A combinatorial spacetime (CGj t) is a smoothly combinatorial manifold C underlying a graph G evolving on a time vector t. As we known, Einstein's general relativity is suitable for use only in one spacetime. What is its disguise in a combinatorial spacetime? Applying combinatorial Riemannian geometry enables us to present a combinatorial spacetime model for the Universe and suggest a generalized Einstein's gravitational equation in such model. For finding its solutions, a generalized relativity principle, called projective principle is proposed, i.e., a physics law in a combinatorial spacetime is invariant under a projection on its a subspace and then a spherically symmetric multisolutions of generalized Einstein's gravitational equations in vacuum or charged body are found. We also consider the geometrical structure in such solutions with physical formations, and conclude that an ultimate theory for the Universe maybe established if all such spacetimes in R3. Otherwise, our theory is only an approximate theory and endless forever.</div>

<div class='title'>Why Over 30 Years Aether Wind Was not Detected in Michelson-Type Experiments with Resonators</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/v_v_demjanov">V.V. Demjanov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We show that measured by S.Herrmann et al., Phys.Rev.D 80, 105011 (2009) small (but finite) value of relative variation (&delta;&nu;/&nu;&gt;0) of the resonance frequency of an evacuated optical resonator, when changing its orientation in space, can not serve as an indication of the absence of a preferred direction concerned with the absolute motion of the setup. On the contrary, the finiteness &delta;&nu;/&nu;&gt;0 testifies to spatial anisotropy of the velocity of light. In order to detect the absolute motion and determine the value and direction of its velocity, the volume of the resonator should be regarded, at any degree of evacuation, as being an optical medium, with its refractive index &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&gt;1 to be necessarily taken into account, irrespective of the extent to be the medium's tenuity. In this event the residual pressure of the evacuated medium should be controlled: that will ensure the magnitude of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; to be known at least to the first significant digit after 1.00000... &lt;br&gt; If the working body is a gas then, as in the case of the fringe shift in the interferometer, the shift &delta;&nu; of the resonance frequency of the volume resonator is proportional to &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&ndash;1=&Delta;&epsilon; and to the square of the velocity &upsilon; of absolute motion of the resonator. At sufficiently large values of optical density, &delta;&nu; is proportional to (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&ndash;1)(2&ndash;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)=&Delta;&epsilon;(1&ndash;&Delta;&epsilon;), and at &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&gt;1.5 it may possess such a great value that there even becomes possible a jump of the automatic laser frequency trimmer from the chosen &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-mode of the reference resonator to its adjacent &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&plusmn;1 modes. Taking into account the effect of the medium permittivity by introducing in calculation the actual value &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&gt;1 in experiments with resonators performed by the scheme of the Michelson experiment enabled us to estimate the absolute speed of the Earth as several hundreds kilometers per second.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Using the standard Cayley transform and elementary tools it is reiterated that the conformal compactification of the Minkowski space involves not only the &#65533;cone at infinity&#65533; but also the 2-sphere that is at the base of this cone. We represent this 2-sphere by two additionally marked points on the Penrose diagram for the compactified Minkowski space. Lacks and omissions in the existing literature are described, Penrose diagrams are derived for both, simple compactification and its double covering space, which is discussed in some detail using both the U(2) approach and the exterior and Clifford algebra methods. Using the Hodge &star; operator twistors (i.e. vectors of the pseudo-Hermitian space H&lt;usb&gt;2;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are realized as spinors (i.e., vectors of a faithful irreducible representation of the even Clifford algebra) for the conformal group SO(4,2)/Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Killing vector fields corresponding to the left action of U(2) on itself are explicitly calculated. Isotropic cones and corresponding projective quadrics in H&lt;sub&gt;p;q&lt;/sub&gt; are also discussed. Applications to flat conformal structures, including the normal Cartan connection and conformal development has been discussed in some detail.</div>

<div class='title'>Could Gravitons from Prior Universe Survive Quantum Bounce to Reappear in Present Universe</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/andrew_beckwith">Andrew Beckwith</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We ask the question if an entropy S = E/T with a usual value ascribed of initial entropy S ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; of the onset of inflation can allow an order of magnitude resolution of the question of if there could be a survival of a graviton from a prior to the present universe, using typical Planckian peak temperature values of T ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; GeV. We obtain the values consistent with up to 1038 gravitons contributing to an energy value of E ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; GeV if we assume a relic energy contribution based upon each graviton initially exhibiting a frequency spike of 1010 Hz. The value of E ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; GeV is picked from looking at the aftermath of what happens if there exists a quantum bounce with a peak density value of &rho;&lt;sub&gt;maximum&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 2.07 &rho;&lt;sub&gt;Planck&lt;/sub&gt; as has been considered recently by P. Malkiewicz and W. Piechocki [15] in the LQG bounce regime radii of the order of magnitude of l ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; meters. In this paper estimates specifically avoids using S = (E - &mu;N)/T are done, by setting vanishing chemical potential &mu; = 0 for ultra high temperatures. Finally we compare briefly the obtained results with the ones recently investigated by G. 't Hooft [20] and L.A. Glinka [21, 22].</div>

<div class='title'>Transition of Expansion Acceleration of the Universe Through Negative Mass</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This letter explains that density of positive mass and negative mass is almost uniformly throughout the whole universe, but density of positive mass and negative mass included in a random universe radius R can be different from each other. Like this, positive, zero, negative values of total gravitational potential energy are all possible due to density difference of positive mass and negative mass included in a random universe radius R. This letter is showing possibility in explaining the decelerating expansion and accelerating expansion due to density difference of positive mass and negative mass because negative mass and positive mass conducts different forms of movement depending on the density difference of positive mass and negative mass. As change of total gravitational potential energy sign occurs from UT=0 and total gravitational potential energy oscillates based on 0. This provides valid explanation regarding to the problems of the atness of the universe and fine tuning.</div>

<div class='title'>Why Shamir and Fox Did not Detect &quot;Aether Wind&quot; in 1969?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/v_v_demjanov">V.V. Demjanov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Up to 1960ies the measurement of the aether wind velocity by the technology of Michelson presumed that a medium placed across the path of light rays has no substantial significance (except as being an obstacle) for obtaining the expected shift of the interference fringe from the brought together orthogonal rays on the interference of the turnabout device. In 1960ties several authors began independent research on the Michelson-type interferometers with different optical media used as light carriers. J.Shamir and R.Fox declared &quot;negative&quot; the results of their measurements on the plexiglas (though they registered the fringe shift 1/3000 fraction of the fringe's width and determined the respective velocity of aether wind 6.5 km/s). The authors considered this result as &quot;enhancing the experimental basis of special relativity&quot;, and their report has been published. My results of same years appeared to be positive. I managed to register on gaseous, liquid and solid optically transparent bodies hundred times greater relative shifts of the fringe (0.01-5.0) giving for horizontal projection of the aether wind velocity the value hundreds km/s. At different times of day and night at the latitude of Obninsk city I registered the changing of this velocity in the interval 140-480 km/s. Insofar as my results &quot;weaken the experimental basis of special relativity&quot;, their publication is still refused. I will show in the present report, basing on my experimental experience, that in reality Shamir and Fox obtained positive results. The historical precedence of misunderstanding the positive measurements of aether wind of the order 200-400 km/s, performed by Michelson and Miller in 1920-1930ies at lengthened to 32 m air light carriers, described by me in arXiv:0910.5658v3, 24 June 2010, repeated in the work by Shamir and Fox. Misunderstood was another artifact, manifesting itself in an interferometer with a solid light carrier. In the current work, I explain the nature of this artifact, hiding from Shamir and Fox their experimental success in detecting the aether wind velocity of hundreds km/s. I discussed also the inadequacy of their own interpretation of the results.</div>

<div class='title'>Special Theory of Relativity in Absolute Space and the Symmetric Twin Paradox ( On the Possibility of Absolute Motion )</div>

<div class='abstract'>Departing from the traditional case where one twin stays put while the other rockets into space, we consider the case of identically accelerated twins. Both twins depart at uniform relativistic speeds in opposite directions for a round trip from the Earth on their 21th birthday destined into space to some distant constellation that is a distance L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the rest frame of the Earth. A &quot;proper&quot; application of the Special Theory of Relativity (STR) tells us that the Earth bound observers will conclude that on the day of reunion, both twins must both have aged the same albeit their clocks (which where initially synchronized with that of the Earth bound observers) will have registered a duration less than that registered by the Earth bound observers. In the traditional twin paradox, it is argued that the stay at home twin will have aged more than the traveling twin and the asymmetry is attributed to the fact that the travelling twin's frame of reference is not an inertial reference frame during the periods of acceleration and deceleration making it illegal for the travelling twin to use the STR in their frame, thus &quot;resolving&quot; the paradox. This same argument does not hold in the case considered here as both twins will undergo identical experiences where each twin sees the other as the one that is in motion. This means, each twin must conclude that the other twin is the one that is younger. They will conclude that their ages must be numerically different, thus disagreeing with the Earth bound observers that their ages are the same. This leads us to a true paradox whose resolution is found in the deduction that motion must be absolute. We provide a thought-experiment on how to measure absolute motion. Through this thought-experiment, we extend the second postulate of the STR to include the direction of propagation of light, namely that not only is the speed of light the same for all observers, but the direction of propagation as-well. Succinctly, the speed of light along its direction of motion in the absolute frame of reference is the same for all observers in the Universe. In an effort to try and resolve the symmetric twin paradox, we set-forth a relativistic aether model, which at best can be described as the Special Theory of Relativity in Absolute Space. By recalibrating several experiments performed by other researchers in the past, we find that the Earth's speed through the aether is in the range 240 &plusmn; 80 kms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Natario Warp Drive is one of the most exciting Spacetimes of General Relativity.It was the second Spacetime Metric able to develop Superluminal Velocities.However in the literature about Warp Drives the Natario Spacetime is only marginally quoted. Almost all the available literature covers the Alcubierre Warp Drive. It is our intention to present here the fully developed Natario Warp Drive Spacetime and its very interesting features.Our presentation is given in a more accessible mathematical formalism following the style of the current Warp Drive literature destined to graduate students of physics since the original Natario Warp Drive paper of 2001 was presented in a sophisticated mathematical formalism not accessible to average students. Like the Alcubierre Warp Drive Spaceime that requires a continuous function f(rs) in order to be completely analyzed or described we introduce here the Natario Shape Function n(r) that allows ourselves to study the amazing physical features of the Natario Warp Drive. The non-existence of a continuous Shape Function for the Natario Warp Drive in the original 2001 work was the reason why Natario Warp Drive was not covered by the standard literature in the same degree of coverage dedicated to the Alcubierre Warp Drive. We hope to change the situation because the Natario Warp Drive looks very promising.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Rotating the source of light around the point lying on the light's beam we can observe the transverse Doppler effect by a spectrometer located in the center of rotation. The anomalous shift of the electromagnetic wave's frequency was found from this experiment (performed in 1969-1974 years) that appeared to be much higher than anticipated from the standard relativistic expression taking into account solely the linear velocity of rotation of the source in the laboratory. The interpretation of the experimental observations admitting absolute motion of the Earth and respective accounting for reality of the Lorentz contraction and time dilation enabled us to determine the speed of the Earth relative to luminiferous aether. It appeared to be somewhat above 400 km/s that agrees well with the value formerly found by me using three methods of determining the speed of &quot;aether wind&quot; by Michelson-type interferometers thoroughly accounted for refractive indices of optical media.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This short letter manifests how Smarandache geometries can be employed in order to extend the &quot;classical&quot; (Riemannian geometry) basis of the General Theory of Relativity through joining the properties of two or more (different) geometries in the same single space. Perspectives in this way seem much profitly: the basic space-time of General Relativity can be extended to not only metric geometries, but even to non-metric ones (where no distances can be measured), or to spaces of the mixed kind which possess the properties of both metric and non-metric spaces (the latter should be referred to as &quot;semi-metric spaces&quot;). If both metric and non-metric properties possessed at the same (at least one) point of a space, it is one of Smarandache geometries, and should be referred to as &quot;Smarandache semi-metric space&quot;. Such spaces can be introduced according to the mathematical apparatus of physically observable quantities (chronometric invariants), if considering a breaking of the observable space metric on the continuous background of the fundamental metric tensor.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Determination to make the Einstein's treatment of simultaneity and relativistic notions of length and time interval measurement more intuitive and illustrative led to creation of a model in which light impulses are substituted with sound signals. The model uncovers the substance of Einstein's mathematical constructs and the mechanisms that give rise to relativistic effects. Consistent application of the model resulted in new constructions. The paper examines known mechanical and electromagnetic phenomena that can be clarified by this model. The use of such an approach leads to the notion of a distinguished frame of reference. In particular, the theory calls for the existence of electromagnetic interaction that contradicts the principle of relativity. The paper contains a description of an experimental apparatus built to test this prediction, as well as the results of the experiments.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this work the authors apply concepts of Neutrosophic Logic to the General Theory of Relativity to obtain a generalisation of Einstein's fourdimensional pseudo-Riemannian differentiable manifold in terms of Smarandache Geometry (Smarandache manifolds), by which new classes of relativistic particles and non-quantum teleportation are developed. Fundamental features of Neutrosophic Logic are its denial of the Law of Excluded Middle, and open (or estimated) levels of truth, falsity and indeterminancy. Both Neutrosophic Logic and Smarandache Geometry were invented some years ago by one of the authors (F. Smarandache). The application of these purely mathematical theories to General Relativity reveals hitherto unknown possibilities for Einstein's theory. The issue of how closely the new theoretical possibilities account for physical phenomena, and indeed the viability of the concept of a fourdimensional space-time continuum itself as a fundamental model of Nature, must of course be explored by experiment.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This seminal study deals with the exact solution of Einstein's field equations for a sphere of incompressible liquid without the additional limitation initially introduced in 1916 by Karl Schwarzschild, according to which the space-time metric must have no singularities. The obtained exact solution is then applied to the Universe, the Sun, and the planets, by the assumption that these objects can be approximated as spheres of incompressible liquid. It is shown that gravitational collapse of such a sphere is permitted for an object whose characteristics (mass, density, and size) are close to the Universe. Meanwhile, there is a spatial break associated with any of the mentioned stellar objects: the break is determined as the approaching to infinity of one of the spatial components of the metric tensor. In particular, the break of the Sun's space meets the Asteroid strip, while Jupiter's space break meets the Asteroid strip from the outer side. Also, the space breaks of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are located inside the Asteroid strip (inside the Sun's space break).</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dmitri_rabounski">Dmitri Rabounski</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This study applies the mathematical method of chronometric invariants, which are physically observable quantities in the four-dimensional space-time (Zelmanov A.L., Soviet Physics Doklady, 1956, vol.1, 227-230). The isotropic region of the space-time is considered (it is known as the isotropic space). This is the home of massless light-like particles (e.g. photons). It is shown that the isotropic space rotates with a linear velocity equal to the velocity of light. The rotation slows in the presence of gravitation. Even under the simplified conditions of Special Relativity, the isotropic space still rotates with the velocity of light. A manifestation of this effect is the observed Hubble redshift explained as energy loss of photons with distance, for work against the non-holonomity (rotation) field of the isotropic space wherein they travel (Rabounski D. The Abraham Zelmanov Journal, 2009, vol.2, 11-28). It is shown that the light-speed rotation of the isotropic space has a purely geometrical origin due to the space-time metric, where time is presented as the fourth coordinate, expressed through the velocity of light.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dmitri_rabounski">Dmitri Rabounski</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In General Relativity, the change in energy of a freely moving photon is given by the scalar equation of the isotropic geodesic equations, which manifests the work produced on a photon being moved along a path. I solved the equation in terms of physical observables (Zelmanov A. L., Soviet Physics Doklady, 1956, vol. 1, 227-230) and in the large scale approximation, i.e. with gravitation and deformation neglected, while supposing the isotropic space to be globally non-holonomic (the time lines are non-orthogonal to the spatial section, a condition manifested by the rotation of the space). The solution is E = E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; exp(-&Omega;at/c), where &Omega; is the angular velocity of the space (it meets the Hubble constant H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = c/a = 2.3x10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), a is the radius of the Universe, t = r/c is the time of the photon's travel. Thus, a photon loses energy with distance due to the work against the field of the space non-holonomity. According to the solution, the redshift should be z = exp(H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; r/c)-1 &asymp; H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; r/c. This solution explains both the redshift z = H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; r/c observed at small distances and the non-linearity of the empirical Hubble law due to the exponent (at large r). The ultimate redshift in a non-expanding universe, according to the theory, should be z = exp(&pi;)-1 = 22.14.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The two-world background of the Special Theory of Relativity started in part one of this article is continued in this second part. Four-dimensional inversion is shown to be a special Lorentz transformation that transforms the positive spacetime coordinates of a frame of reference in the positive universe into the negative spacetime coordinates of the symmetry-partner frame of reference in the negative universe in the two-world picture, contrary to the conclusion that four-dimensional inversion is impossible as actual transformation of the coordinates of a frame of reference in the existing one-world picture. By starting with the negative spacetime dimensions in the negative universe derived in part one, the signs of mass and other physical parameters and physical constants in the negative universe are derived by application of the symmetry of laws between the positive and negative universes. The invariance of natural laws in the negative universe is demonstrated. The derived negative sign of mass in the negative universe is a conclusion of over a century-old effort towards the development of the concept of negative mass in physics.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/akindele_j_adekugbe">Akindele O. J. Adekugbe</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A new sheet of spacetime is isolated and added to the existing sheet, thereby yielding a pair of co-existing sheets of spacetimes, which are four-dimensional inversions of each other. The separation of the spacetimes by the special-relativistic event horizon compels an interpretation of the existence of a pair of symmetrical worlds (or universes) in nature. Further more, a flat two-dimensional intrinsic spacetime that underlies the flat four-dimensional spacetime in each universe is introduced. The four-dimensional spacetime is outward manifestation of the two-dimensional intrinsic spacetime, just as the Special Theory of Relativity (SR) on four-dimensional spacetime is mere outward manifestation of the intrinsic Special Theory of Relativity (&phi;SR) on two-dimensional intrinsic spacetime. A new set of diagrams in the two-world picture that involves relative rotation of the coordinates of the two-dimensional intrinsic spacetime is drawn and intrinsic Lorentz transformation derived from it. The Lorentz transformation in SR is then written directly from intrinsic Lorentz transformation in &phi;SR without any need to draw diagrams involving relative rotation of the coordinates of four-dimensional spacetime, as usually done until now. Indeed every result of SR can be written directly from the corresponding result of &phi;SR. The non-existence of the light cone concept in the two-world picture is shown and good prospect for making the Lorentz group SO(3,1) compact in the two-world picture is highlighted.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The proposal for dark energy based on Type Ia Supernovae redshift is examined. It is found that the linear and non-Linear portions in the Hubble Redshift are easily explained by the use of the Hubble Sphere model, where two interacting Hubble spheres sharing a common mass-energy density result in a decrease in energy as a function of distance from the object being viewed. Interpreting the non-linear portion of the redshift curve as a decrease in interacting volume between neighboring Hubble Spheres removes the need for a dark energy.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We study the effects of a non-singular gravitational potential on satellite orbits by deriving the corresponding time rates of change of its orbital elements. This is achieved by expanding the non-singular potential into power series up to second order. This series contains three terms, the first been the Newtonian potential and the other two, here R1 (first order term) and R2 (second order term), express deviations of the singular potential from the Newtonian. These deviations from the Newtonian potential are taken as disturbing potential terms in the Lagrange planetary equations that provide the time rates of change of the orbital elements of a satellite in a non-singular gravitational field. We split these effects into secular, low and high frequency components and we evaluate them numerically using the low Earth orbiting mission Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We show that the secular effect of the second-order disturbing term R2 on the perigee and the mean anomaly are 4&quot;.307*10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;/a, and -2&quot;.533*10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt;/a, respectively. These effects are far too small and most likely cannot easily be observed with today's technology. Numerical evaluation of the low and high frequency effects of the disturbing term R2 on low Earth orbiters like GRACE are very small and undetectable by current observational means.</div>

<div class='abstract'>General Relativity predicts the existence of relativistic corrections to the static Newtonian potential which can be calculated and verified experimentally. The idea leading to quantum corrections at large distances is that of the interactions of massless particles which only involve their coupling energies at low energies. In this short paper we attempt to propose the Sagnac intrerferometric technique as a way of detecting the relativistic correction suggested for the Newtonian potential, and thus obtaining an estimate for phase difference using a satellite orbiting at an altitude of 250 km above the surface of the Earth.</div>

The calculation has been performed using a non-exact Schwarzschild solution, and further assuming that the gravitational field of the Earth is more than that of a rotating mass. General theory of relativity predicts that the direction of the gyroscope will change at a rate of 6.6 arcsec/year for a gyroscope in a 650 km high polar orbit. In our case a precession rate of the spin of a very similar magnitude to that predicted by general relativity was calculated resulting to a &Delta;S&lt;sub&gt;geo&lt;/sub&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;geo&lt;/sub&gt; =-5.570*10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;</div>

<div class='abstract'>This is a research on all kinds of particles, which could be conceivable in the space-time of General Relativity. In addition to mass-bearing particles and light-like particles, zero-particles are predicted: such particles can exist in a fully degenerate space-time region (zero-space). Zero-particles seems as standing light waves, which travel in instant (non-quantum teleportation of photons); they might be observed in a further development of the &quot;stopped light experiment&quot; which was first conducted in 2001, at Harvard, USA. The theoretical existence of two separate regions in the space-time is also shown, where the observable time flows into the future and into the past (our world and the mirror world). These regions are separated by a space-time membrane wherein the observable time stops. A few other certain problems are considered. It is shown, through Killing's equations, that geodesic motion of particles is a result of stationary geodesic rotation of the space which hosts them. Concerning the theory of gravitational wave detectors, it is shown that both free-mass detector and solid-body detector may register a gravitational wave only if such a detector bears an oscillation of the butt-ends.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this book, we build the theory of non-geodesic motion of particles in the space-time of General Relativity. Motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field is constructed in curved space-time (in contrast to the regular considerations held in Minkowski's space of Special Relativity). Spin particles are explained in the framework of the variational principle: this approach distinctly shows that elementary particles should have masses governed by a special quantum relation. Physical vacuum and forces of non-Newtonian gravitation acting in it are determined through the lambda-term in Einstein's equations. A cosmological concept of the inversion explosion of the Universe from a compact object with the radius of an electron is suggested. Physical conditions inside a membrane that separates space-time regions where the observable time flows into the future and into the past (our world and the mirror world) are examined.</div>

<div class='title'>Tidal Charges From BraneWorld Black Holes As An Experimental Proof Of The Higher Dimensional Nature Of The Universe.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/fernando_loup">Fernando Loup</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>If the Universe have more than 4 Dimensions then its Extra Dimensional Nature generates in our 4D Spacetime a projection of a 5D Bulk Weyl Tensor. We demonstrate that this happens not only in the Randall-Sundrum BraneWorld Model where this idea appeared first (developed by Shiromizu, Maeda and Sasaki)but also occurs in the Kaluza-Klein 5D Induced Matter Formalism.As a matter of fact this 5D Bulk Weyl Tensor appears in every Extra Dimensional Formalism (eg Basini-Capozziello-Wesson-Overduin Dimensional Reduction From 5D to 4D) because this Bulk Weyl tensor is being generated by the Extra Dimensional Nature of the Universe regardless and independently of the Mathematical Formalism used and the Dimensional Reduction From 5D to 4D of the Einstein and Ricci Tensors in both Kaluza-Klein and Randall-Sundrum Formalisms are similar.Also as in the Randall-Sundrum Model this 5D Bulk Weyl Tensor generates in the Kaluza-Klein formalism a Tidal &quot;Electric&quot; Charge &quot;seen&quot; in 4D as an Extra Term in the Schwarzschild Metric resembling the Reissner-Nordstrom Metric. We analyze the Gravitational Bending Of Light in this BraneWorld Black Hole Metric(known as the Dadhich,Maartens,Papadopolous and Rezania) affected by an Extra Term due to the presence of the Tidal Charge compared to the Bending Of Light in the Reissner-Nordstrom Metric with the Electric Charge also being generated by the Extra Dimension in agreement with the point of view of Ponce De Leon (explaining in the generation process how and why antiparticles have the same rest mass m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but charges of equal modulus and opposite signs when compared to particles)and unlike the Reissner-Nordstrom Metric the terms G/(c&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) do not appear in the Tidal Charge Extra Term.Thereby we conclude that the Extra Term produced by the Tidal Charge in the Bending Of Light due to the presence of the Extra Dimensions is more suitable to be detected than its Reissner-Nordstrom counterpart and this line of reason is one of the best approaches to test the Higher Dimensional Nature of the Universe and we describe a possible experiment using Artificial Satellites and the rotating BraneWorld Black Hole Metric to do so</div>

<div class='abstract'>Giovanni Amelino-Camelia (2002) has proposed a theory whose hope (should it be confirmed by experiments) is to supersede Einstein's 1905 Special Theory of Relativity (STR). This theory is known as the Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) and it proposes a new observer-independent scale-length. At this scale, it is agreed that a particle that has reached this scale-length, has entered the Quantum Gravity regime. According to the STR, observers will - in principle; not agree on whether or not a particle has reached this length hence they will not agree as to when does a particle enter the Quantum Gravity regime. This presents the STR with a &quot;paradox&quot;. Amongst others, the DSR is fashioned to solve this &quot;puzzle/paradox&quot;. We argue/show here, that the STR already implies such a scale-length - it is the complete embodiment of the STR, thus we are left to excogitate; &quot;Is the Doubly Special Relativity theory necessary?&quot;.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/bruce_rout">Bruce Rout</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>To date, methods of direct measurement of the distance to galaxies have been limited in their range[1]. This paper makes direct measurements of distant galaxies by comparing spiral arm structures to the expected locus of gravitational influence along the geodesic in a centripetally accelerating reference frame. Such measurements provide a method of independent validation of the extragalactic distance ladder without presupposition of the uniformly expanding universe theory. The methodology of this paper avoids the use of Hubble's constant in the measurement of the distance to galaxies beyond the range of contemporary direct measurement methods. The measurements are validated by meaningful trends between distance and other variables such as mass, rotational velocity, size and angular momentum to validate the measurements made. A Hubble diagram calculated using this method is presented from data obtained from 111 spiral galaxies in the southern hemisphere to about 200 MPc distance. The galactic red shift from these galaxies appears independent to distance. Galactic structure, size, masses and angular momentum are seen to have a distinct relationship to the spin velocity, or tangential velocity, associated with each galaxy.</div>

<div class='title'>A Comparisson of Distance Measurements to NGC 4258</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/bruce_rout">Bruce Rout</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The accurate measurement of extragalactic distances is a central challenge of modern astronomy, being required for any realistic description of the age, geometry and fate of the Universe. The measurement of relative extragalactic distances has become fairly routine, but estimates of absolute distances are rare.[1] In the vicinity of the Sun, direct geometric techniques for obtaining absolute distances, such as orbital parallax, are feasible, but heretofore such techniques have been difficult to apply to other galaxies. As a result, uncertainties in the expansion rate and age of the Universe are dominated by uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the extragalactic distance ladder[2]. Here we compare previous distance measurements to the galaxy NGC 4258 from both an estimate of Hubble's constant and a direct measurement of orbital motions in a disk of gas surrounding the nucleus of this galaxy to a direct measurement using a model of constant rotational velocity and galactic spiral morphology. The results of the comparison help validate methods of direct measurement of spiral galaxies to much greater distances.</div>

<div class='title'>Discovery of a New Dimming Effect Specific to Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/thomas_b_andrews">Thomas B. Andrews</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Because type Ia supernovae (SNs) are anomalously dimmed with respect to the at (q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5) Friedman Expanding Universe model, I was surprised to find that the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are not anomalously dimmed. Based on the absence of anomalous dimming in BCGs, the following conclusions were reached: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&sdot; Since the light from the SNs and BCGs traverses the same space, the current hypothesis of an accelerated expansion of the universe to explain the anomalous dimming of SNs is disproved.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&sdot; The cause of the anomalous dimming must be specific to the SNs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; The first conclusion is important since current research in dark energy and the cosmological constant was initiated based on the accelerated expansion hypothesis. The disproof of this hypothesis, therefore, casts serious doubts on the existence of dark energy and the cosmological constant. The second conclusion indicates that the occurrence of anomalous dimming depends on a basic difference between the SNs and BCGs. The only difference besides the obvious - that SNs are exploding stars and the BCGs are galaxies - is that the light curves of the SNs are limited in duration. Due on this difference, I discovered that SNs light curves are broadened at the observer by a new Hubble redshift effect. Since the total energy of the light curve is then spread over a longer time period, the apparent luminosity is reduced at the observer, causing the observed anomalous dimming of SNs. I also show that BCGs are not anomalously dimmed because their absolute luminosity is approximately constant over the time required for the light to reach the observer. The above conclusions also apply to Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) since gamma-ray &quot;light&quot; curves are limited in duration. Finally, the light curve broadening effect can be used to determine if the universe is expanding or static. In the expanding universe model, a light curve broadening effect is predicted due to time-dilation for the SNs, GRBs and BCGs. Consequently, if the universe is expanding, two light curve broadening effects should occur for the SNs and GRBs. However, if the universe is static, only one light curve broadening effect will occur for the SNs and GRBs. Fortunately, Golhaber has measured the width's of SNs light curves and conclusively showed that only one light curve broadening effect occurs. Consequently, the expanding universe model is logically falsified.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Novel static, time-dependent and spatial-temporal solutions of Einstein field equations, displaying singularities, with and without horizons, and in several dimensions are found based on a dimensional reduction procedure widely used in Kaluza-Klein type theories. The Kerr-Newman black-hole entropy as well as the Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr and Schwarzschild black-hole entropy are derived from the corresponding Euclideanized actions. A very special cosmological model based on the dynamical interior geometry of a Black Hole is found that has no singularities at t = 0 due to the smoothing of the mass distribution. We conclude with another cosmological model equipped also with a dynamical horizon and which is related to Vaidya's metric (associated with the Hawking-radiation of black holes) by interchanging t &harr; r which might render our universe as a dynamical black hole.</div>

<div class='title'>The Euclidean Gravitational Action as Black Hole Entropy, Singularities and Spacetime Voids</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We argue why the static spherically symmetric (SSS) vacuum solutions of Einstein's equations described by the textbook Hilbert metric g&lt;sub&gt;&mu;&nu;&lt;/sub&gt;(r) is not diffeomorphic to the metric g&lt;sub&gt;&mu;&nu;&lt;/sub&gt;(|r|) corresponding to the gravitational field of a point mass delta function source at r = 0. By choosing a judicious radial function R(r) = r + 2G|M|&Theta;(r) involving the Heaviside step function, one has the correct boundary condition R(r = 0) = 0 , while displacing the horizon from r = 2G|M| to a location arbitrarily close to r = 0 as one desires, r&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; &rarr; 0, where stringy geometry and quantum gravitational effects begin to take place. We solve the field equations due to a delta function point mass source at r = 0, and show that the Euclidean gravitational action (in &#8463; units) is precisely equal to the black hole entropy (in Planck area units). This result holds in any dimensions D &ge; 3 . In the Reissner-Nordsrom (massive-charged) and Kerr-Newman black hole case (massive-rotating-charged) we show that the Euclidean action in a bulk domain bounded by the inner and outer horizons is the same as the black hole entropy. When one smears out the point-mass and point-charge delta function distributions by a Gaussian distribution, the areaentropy relation is modified. We postulate why these modifications should furnish the logarithmic corrections (and higher inverse powers of the area) to the entropy of these smeared Black Holes.

<div class='title'>The Cosmological Constant and Pioneer Anomaly from Weyl Spacetimes and Mach's Principle</div>

<div class='abstract'>It is shown how Weyl's geometry and Mach's Holographic principle furnishes both the magnitude and sign (towards the sun) of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration a&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; ~ -c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;Hubble&lt;/sub&gt; firstly observed by Anderson et al.

<div class='title'>The Clifford Space Geometry Behind the Pioneer and Flyby Anomalies</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is rigorously shown how the Extended Relativity Theory in Clifford spaces (C-spaces) can explain the variable radial dependence a&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(r) of the Pioneer anomaly; its sign (pointing towards the sun); why planets don't experience the anomalous acceleration and why the present day value of the Hubble scale R&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; appears. It is the curvature-spin coupling of the planetary motions that hold the key. The difference in the rate at which clocks tick in C-space translates into the C-space analog of Doppler shifts which may explain the anomalous redshifts in Cosmology, where objects which are not that far apart from each other exhibit very different redshifts. We conclude by showing how the empirical formula for the Flybys anomalies obtained by Anderson et al. can be derived within the framework of Clifford geometry.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Coupling system between Gaussian type-microwave photon flux, static magnetic field and fractal membranes (or other equivalent microwave lenses) can be used to detect high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) in the microwave band. We study the signal photon flux, background photon flux and the requisite minimal accumulation time of the signal in the coupling system. Unlike pure inverse Gertsenshtein effect (G-effect) caused by the HFGWs in the GHz band, the the electromagnetic (EM) detecting scheme (EDS) proposed by China and the US HFGW groups is based on the composite effect of the synchro-resonance effect and the inverse G-effect. Key parameters in the scheme is the first-order perturbative photon flux (PPF) and not the second-order PPF; the distinguishable signal is the transverse first-order PPF and not the longitudinal PPF; the photon flux focused by the fractal membranes or other equivalent microwave lenses is not only the transverse first-order PPF but the total transverse photon flux, and these photon fluxes have different signal-to-noise ratios at the different receiving surfaces. Theoretical analysis and numerical estimation show that the requisite minimal accumulation time of the signal at the special receiving surfaces and in the background noise fluctuation would be ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; seconds for the typical laboratory condition and parameters of h&lt;sub&gt;r.m.s.&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;-26&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;-30&lt;/sup&gt;/&radic;Hz at 5GHz with bandwidth ~1Hz. In addition, we review the inverse G-effect in the EM detection of the HFGWs, and it is shown that the EM detecting scheme based only on the pure inverse G-effect in the laboratory condition would not be useful to detect HFGWs in the microwave band.</div>

<div class='title'>Hypothesis of Dark Matter and Dark Energy with Negative Mass</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hyoyoung_choi">Hyoyoung Choi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>From the observance of the HSS team and SCP team in 1998, they gained the mass density of the negative(HSS: &Omega;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.38(&plusmn;0.22), SCP: &Omega;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.4(&plusmn;0.1) ), using field equations which do not have the cosmological constant. In they thought, the quantity of the mass couldn't be a negative value, so the value was discarded. We have to know that not the field equation has disposed the value, but our thought disposed that value. In the world of positive mass, ground state is a point that energy is low, but in case of negative mass, ground state is a point that energy is the highest. Accordingly, in the world of negative mass, energy level is filled from the highest to the lowest, and stable state means the highest energy state, so the catastrophe to energy level of minus infinity never happens even if negative mass spontaneously emits energy. Assuming that negative mass exists, Newton's Law of motion was derived in between negative and positive masses and also between negative and negative masses. As a method for proving the existence of negative mass, an explanation on the revolution velocity of the galaxy through negative mass has been presented. In this process, the existence of spherical mass distribution was given; furthermore, explanation was done using this, to show observation results where dark matter effect through negative mass is proportional to distance r. If &Omega;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is -0.38, universe's age is 14.225 Gyr. It is in the range estimated by other observations. Universe's radius R is 96:76[&lt;sub&gt;-11:44&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+12:13&lt;/sup&gt;]Gly = (85.32 ~ 108.89)Gly. Assuming that negative mass and positive mass were born together at the beginning of universe, it satisfies the various problems that previous dark matter and dark energy possess, such as, centripetal force effects of galaxy and galaxy clusters from previous dark matters, mass effects that is proportional to the distance r, repulsive force needed for expansion, dark energy that has positive values, low interaction between dark matter when collision occurs between dark matter, deceleration expansion and acceleration expansion of universe, formation of void, in ation mechanism, fine tuning problem of mass density, collision of Bullet cluster, universe's age, universe's size, the reason of that dark energy seems to has a small and non-zero value. Also, we prove to the dark energy observation value (10&lt;sup&gt;-47&lt;/sup&gt;GeV&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). As a result, the necessity of observation focusing on exact computation and detection of negative mass is stated.</div>

<div class='title'>On Dark Energy, Weyl Geometry and Brans-Dicke-Jordan Scalar Field</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We review firstly why Weyl's Geometry, within the context of Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, can account for both the origins and the value of the observed vacuum energy density (dark energy). The source of dark energy is just the dilaton-like Jordan-Brans-Dicke scalar field that is required to implement Weyl invariance of the most simple of all possible actions. A nonvanishing value of the vacuum energy density of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;-123&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Planck&lt;/sub&gt; is derived in agreement with the experimental observations. Next, a Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity model within the context of ordinary Riemannian geometry, yields also the observed vacuum energy density (cosmological constant) to very high precision. One finds that the temporal flow of the scalar field &phi;(t) in ordinary Riemannian geometry, from t = 0 to t = to, has the same numerical effects (as far as the vacuum energy density is concerned) as if there were Weyl scalings from the field configuration &phi;(t), to the constant field configuration &phi;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, in Weyl geometry. Hence, Weyl scalings in Weyl geometry can recapture the flow of time which is consistent with Segal's Conformal Cosmology, in such a fashion that an expanding universe may be visualized as Weyl scalings of a static universe. The main novel result of this work is that one is able to reproduce the observed vacuum energy density to such a degree of precision 10&lt;sup&gt;-123&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Planck&lt;/sub&gt;, while still having a Big-Bang singularity at t = 0 when the vacuum energy density blows up. This temporal flow of the vacuum energy density, from very high values in the past, to very small values today, is not a numerical coincidence but is the signal of an underlying Weyl geometry (conformal invariance) operating in cosmology, combined with the dynamics of a Brans-Dicke-Jordan scalar field.</div>

<div class='title'>A Theory of Gravity Based on Quantum Clocks and Moving Space</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/e_p_j_de_haas">E.P.J. de Haas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A theory of gravity based on quantum clocks and moving space is proposed. The theory is based on the hypothesis of the quantum clock equivalence principle (QCEP): it is impossible for a locally isolated observer to distinguish between a red-shift in a moving inertial frame of reference and a red-shift in a reference frame that is at rest in a field of gravity, if the red-shift is all the information he has. This allows us to formulate a time-dilatation measurement based definition of the speed of space in a gravity field. The QCEP is then used to predict the frequency shift of a quantum clock at rest in a g-field, moving in a closed circular orbit and in free fall. The cosmological and quantum gravitational possibilities of the QCEP hypothesis are shortly mentioned.</div>

<div class='abstract'>M.W. Evans tried to relate the electromagnetic field strength to the torsion of a Riemann-Cartan spacetime. We show that this ansatz is untenable for at least two reasons: (i) Geometry: Torsion is related to the (external) translation group and cannot be linked to an internal group, like the U(1) group of electrodynamics. (ii) Electrodynamics: The electromagnetic field strength as a 2-form carries 6 independent components, whereas Evans&#65533; electromagnetic construct F&lt;sup&gt;&alpha;&lt;/sup&gt; is a vector-valued 2-form with 24 independent components. This doesn&#65533;t match. One of these reasons is already enough to disprove the ansatz of Evans.</div>

<div class='title'>Born&#65533;s Reciprocal General Relativity Theory and Complex Nonabelian Gravity as Gauge Theory of the Quaplectic Group : A novel path to Quantum Gravity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Born&#65533;s Reciprocal Relativity in flat spacetimes is based on the principle of a maximal speed limit (speed of light) and a maximal proper force (which is also compatible with a maximal and minimal length duality) and where coordinates and momenta are unified on a single footing. We extend Born&#65533;s theory to the case of curved spacetimes and construct a Reciprocal General Relativity theory (in curved spacetimes) as a local Gauge Theory of the Quaplectic Group and given by the semidirect product Q(1, 3) x U(1, 3) sH(1, 3), where the Nonabelian Weyl-Heisenberg group is H(1, 3). The gauge theory has the same structure as that of Complex Nonabelian Gravity. Actions are presented and it is argued why such actions based on Born&#65533;s Reciprocal Relativity principle, involving a maximal speed limit and a maximal proper force, is a very promising avenue to Quantize Gravity that does not rely in breaking the Lorentz symmetry at the Planck scale, in contrast to other approaches based on deformations of the Poincare algebra, Quantum Groups. It is discussed how one could embed the Quaplectic gauge theory into one based on the U(1, 4),U(2, 3) groups where the observed cosmological constant emerges in a natural way. We conclude with a brief discussion of Complex coordinates and Finsler spaces with symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics studied by Eisenhart as relevant closed-string target space backgrounds where Born&#65533;s principle may be operating.</div>

<div class='title'>Real or Imaginary Space-Time? Reality or Relativity?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/c_k_thornhill">C. K. Thornhill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The real space-time of Newtonian mechanics and the ether concept is contrasted with the imaginary space-time of the non-ether concept and relativity. In real space-time (x, y, z, ct) characteristic theory shows that Maxwell&#65533;s equations and sound waves in any uniform fluid at rest have identical wave surfaces. Moreover, without charge or current, Maxwell&#65533;s equations reduce to the same standard wave equation which governs such sound waves. This is not a general and invariant equation but it becomes so by Galilean transformation to any other reference-frame. So also do Maxwell&#65533;s equations which are, likewise, not general but unique to one reference-frame. The mistake of believing that Maxwell&#65533;s equations were invariant led to the Lorentz transformation and to relativity; and to the misinterpretation of the differential equation for the wave cone through any point as the quadratic differential form of a Riemannian metric in imaginary space-time (x, y, z, ict). Mathematics is then required to tolerate the same equation being transformed in different ways for different applications. Otherwise, relativity is untenable and recourse must then be made to real space-time, normal Galilean transformation and an ether with Maxwellian statistics and Planck&#65533;s energy distribution.</div>

<div class='title'>Real and Apparent Invariants in the Transformation of the Equations Governing Wave-Motion in the General Flow of a General Fluid</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/c_k_thornhill">C. K. Thornhill</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The ten equations are derived that govern, to the first order, the propagation of small general perturbations in the general unsteady flow of a general fluid, in three spacevariables and time. The condition that any hypersurface is a wave hypersurface of these equations is obtained, and the envelope of all such wave hypersurfaces that pass through a given point at a given time, i .e . the wave hyperconoid, is determined. These results, which are all invariant under Galilean transformation, are progressively specialized, through homentropic flow and irrotational homentropic flow, to steady uniform flow, for which both the convected wave-equation and the standard waveequation, with their wave hypersurfaces, are finally recovered. A special class of reference-frames is considered, namely those whose origins move with the fluid. It is then shown that, for observers at the origins of all such reference frames, the wave hypersurfaces satisfy specially simple equations locally. These equations are identical with those for waves in a uniform fluid at rest relative to the reference frame, except that the wave speed is not constant but varies with position and time in accordance with the variable mean flow. These specially simple equations appear to be invariant for Galilean transformations between all such observers. These results are briefly applied, in reverse order, to Maxwell&#65533;s equations, and to equations more general than Maxwell&#65533;s, for the electric and magnetic field-strengths.</div>

The true general equations, for an ether in general motion, have been derived and given in the literature for many years but are continually ignored. Here, a further attempt is made to bring home irrefutably the mathematics which negates the concepts of no-ether and non-Newtonian relativity. Alternative derivations of the general equations of electromagnetism are given in the simplest possible terms, from basic principles. It is shown that the mathematical techniques required are exactly the same as those which were used to derive the general equations of fluid motion, long before the advent of Maxwell&#65533;s equations.</div>
