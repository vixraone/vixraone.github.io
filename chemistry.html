<div class='title'>Pesticide Residues in Children&#8217;s Diets A Comprehensive Review of Health Risks, Agroecology, and Policy Implications</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/thiago_m_nobrega">Thiago M. N&#243;brega</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The presence of pesticide residues in children's diets is a significant public health concern. This comprehensive review examines the prevalence of pesticide residues in children's diets, the potential health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals, and the role of agroecology in promoting healthier food options. I've conducted a literature review, comparative analysis, policy analysis, and case studies to gain a deeper understanding of this issue and identify potential policy changes and interventions needed to address it. My findings indicate that promoting agroecology and organic food production can reduce the reliance on chemical pesticides and provide healthier food options for children. Furthermore, implementing and expanding farm-to-school programs and prioritizing organic food in school feeding programs can help reduce children's exposure to pesticide residues. By raising public awareness and investing in research on the health impacts of pesticide residues, we can work towards creating a safer and healthier food system for future generations.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We study the Oxford Dictionary Of Chemistry, the seventh edition. We draw the natural logarithm of the number of head entries, normalised, starting with a letter vs the natural logarithm of the rank of the letter, normalised. We conclude that the Dictionary can be characterised by BP(4,$beta H=0$) i.e. a magnetisation curve for the Bethe-Peierls approximation of the Ising model with four nearest neighbours with $beta H=0$, in the absence of external magnetic field, H.$beta$ is $frac{1}{k_{B}T}$ where, T is temperature and $k_{B}$ is the tiny Boltzmann constant.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The oscillation symmetry is applied with success to some physical properties (densities, Boiling points, and Melting points) of different Hydrocarbons: Alkanes, Cycloalkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes, Alkadienes, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. It is also applied to Hydro Silicons. It allows to tentatively predict possible values for several unknown properties. The same shape of oscillation describes, sometimes after renormalization, the &quot;mass data&quot; of several particle families, nuclei families and Alkane Melting Point &quot;data&quot;. The periods of oscillation exhibit discret values as if they are quantified.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/humberto_bastidas-ortiz">Humberto Bastidas-Ortiz</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Chlorine dioxide, ClO2, a non-patentable substance, is a molecule composed by two of the most disinfectant elements found in nature, chlorine and oxygen, both of them electronegative. As early as 1850, ClO2 has been being used in the oxidation of water and, since 1944, in the treatment of waste water and the bleaching of cellulose. Similarly, oxygen, in the form of hydrogen peroxide, is used to disinfect ambulances, hospital rooms and medical equipment, among other applications. Recently, the Global Health and Life Coalition (GHLC) has reported favourable results in the treatment of COVID-19 using ClO2 under a parameterized protocol design by scientists members of this organization. Other research works carried out in dierent parts of the world sustain the hypothesis that, as a relatively stable radical and as a highly oxidant regardless of the pH in its surroundings, ClO2 and its application in an area so sensitive as human health presents itself as an alternative worth studying further.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Electrochemical reactions depend on the electrochemical interface; between the catalytic surfaces and the electrolytes. To control and advance electrochemical reactions there is a need to develop realistic simulation models of the electrochemical interface to understand the interface from an atomistic point-of-view. Here we present a method for obtaining thermodynamic realistic interface structures, a procedure to derive specific coverages and to obtain ab initio simulated cyclic voltammograms. As a case study, the method and procedure is applied in a matrix study of three Cu facets in three different electrolyte. The results are validated by a direct comparison with experimental cyclic voltammograms. The alkaline (NaOH) electrolyte CV are described by H* and OH*, while neutral (KHCO3) the CO3* species are present and in acidic (KCl) the Cl* species dominate. An almost one-to-one mapping is observed from simulation to experiments giving an atomistic understanding of the interface structure of the Cu facets. The strength of atomistic understanding the interface at electrolyte conditions will allow realistic investigations of electrochemical reactions in future studies.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A simple visible spectrophotometric method is proposed for the determination of ulipristal acetate present in bulk and tablet formulation. The currently proposed method is established based on MBTH oxidation by ferric ions to form an active coupling species (electrophile), followed by its coupling with the ulipristal in acidic medium to form high intensi&#56256;&#57297;ied green colored chromophore having max at 609 nm. Validated the method as per the current guidelines of ICH. Beer&#8217;s law was obeyed in the concentration range of 6.25 &#8211; 37.50 g mL&#56256;&#56320;1 with a high regression coef&#56256;&#57297;icient (r &gt; 0.999). Reproducibility, accuracy, and precision of the method are evident from the low values of R.S.D. This method can be used in quality control laboratories for routine analysis of ulipristal acetate in bulk drug and pharmaceutical dosage forms.</div>

<div class='abstract'>According to all known laws of chemistry, mystopropane should not be able to form, but it does anyway because mystopropane does not care what humans think is impossible. Recent developments in the intense and very mysterious field of isobutane have revealed different forms of this strange molecule that have been shown to be created in new and novel ways that were previously thought to be impossible. Mystopropane is structurally very similar to isobutane and may look the same to the naked eye (considering one cannot see a molecule with the naked eye). The differences between isobutane and mystopropane will be revealed throughout this study, which will include the in-depth research of scientists like Daved Von Walkerheim II and Devang Deepak. The &#8220;Great Kacklehauser-Shimeryton Debate&#8221; will also be thoroughly mentioned because of its contributions to the continued research on mystopropane.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are among the most medical applications nanomaterials mainly due to its antimicrobial effect, plasmon resonance and its capacity to impregnate polymeric materials. Recently Ag-NPs have been used in water treatment systems, central venous catheters, burn dressing, as well as in biosensors for detecting levels of p53 protein associated with cancer development. Moreover, the Ag-NPs have been studied for being potentially dangerous to humans and environment. Ag-NPs are transformed under the ecosystems conditions and may even increase their aggressiveness. The aim of this paper is to investigate the current state of knowledge about the bactericidal effect of Ag-NPs, the main synthesis methods, its application based on antibiotic capacity, Ag-NPs environmental transformations and their impact on the human.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This article presents a high-throughput computer program, called EasyDD, for batch processing, analyzing and visualizing of spectral data; particularly those related to the new generation of synchrotron detectors and X-ray powder diffraction applications. This computing tool is designed for the treatment of large volumes of data in reasonable time with affordable computational resources. A case study in which this program was used to process and analyze powder diffraction data obtained from the ESRF synchrotron on an alumina-based nickel nanoparticle catalysis system is also presented for demonstration. The development of this computing tool, with the associated protocols, is inspired by a novel approach in spectral data analysis.</div>

<div class='title'>High Throughput Software for Powder Diffraction and its Application to Heterogeneous Catalysis</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/taha_sochi">Taha Sochi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this thesis we investigate high throughput computational methods for processing large quantities of data collected from synchrotrons and their application to spectral analysis of powder diffraction data. We also present the main product of this PhD programme, specifically a software called 'EasyDD' developed by the author. This software was created to meet the increasing demand on data processing and analysis capabilities as required by modern detectors which produce huge quantities of data. Modern detectors coupled with the high intensity X-ray sources available at synchrotrons have led to the situation where datasets can be collected in ever shorter time scales and in ever larger numbers. Such large volumes of datasets pose a data processing bottleneck which augments with current and future instrument development. EasyDD has achieved its objectives and made significant contributions to scientific research. It can also be used as a model for more mature attempts in the future. EasyDD is currently in use by a number of researchers in a number of academic and research institutions to process high-energy diffraction data. These include data collected by different techniques such as Energy Dispersive Diffraction, Angle Dispersive Diffraction and Computer Aided Tomography. EasyDD has already been used in a number of published studies, and is currently in use by the High Energy X-Ray Imaging Technology project. The software was also used by the author to process and analyse datasets collected from synchrotron radiation facilities. In this regard, the thesis presents novel scientific research involving the use of EasyDD to handle large diffraction datasets in the study of alumina-supported metal oxide catalyst bodies. These data were collected using Tomographic Energy Dispersive Diffraction Imaging and Computer Aided Tomography techniques.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this study, supercritical fluid extraction has been successfully applied to a sequential fractionation of fatty acids and polyphenols from wine wastes (2 different vitis vinifera grapes). To this aim, in a 1st step just fatty acids were extracted and in a 2nd one the polyphenols. The variables that affected to the extraction efficiency were separately optimized in both steps following an experimental design approach. The effect of extraction temperature flow, pressure, and time were thoroughly evaluated for the extraction of fatty acids, whereas the addition of methanol was also considered in the case of the polyphenols extraction. A quantitative extraction with high efficiency was achieved at a very short time and low temperatures. Concerning quantification, fatty acids were determined by means of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry after a derivatization step, whereas the polyphenols were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and the Folin&#8211;Ciocalteu method.</div>

<div class='abstract'>2D a-MoO3 was synthesized using a facile, inexpensive and scalable liquid-phase exfoliation method. 2D a-MoO3/SWCNT (85 wt%/15 wt%) composite films were manufactured by vacuum filtration and their energy storage properties were investigated in a LiClO4/propylene carbonate electrolyte in a 1.5 V to 3.5 V vs. Li+/Li electrochemical window. Cyclic voltammetry showed typical ion intercalation peaks of a-MoO3 and a capacitance of 200 F/g was achieved at 10 mV/s and 82 F/g at 50 mV/s. The composite electrodes achieved a capacitive charge storage of 375 C/g and a diffusion-controlled maximum charge storage of 703 C/g. The latter being superior to the charge storage achieved by previously reported mesoporous a-MoO3, produced using more cumbersome multi-step templating methods, and a-MoO3 nanobelts . This superior Li-ion intercalation charge storage was attributed to the shorter ion-transport paths of 2D a-MoO3 as compared to other nanostructures. Galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments showed a maximum charge storage of 123.0 mAh/g at a current density of 100 mA/g.</div>

Results indicated that a simpli&#64257;ed torrefaction process was successful in physical transformation of the hazelnut shell and that the resultant syn-gas was of a relatively higher calori&#64257;c value, together with lower tar content.

<div class='abstract'>In their article, Gharagheizi et al. [J. Chem. Eng. Data 2011, 56, 1741-1750] claim to develop a model to predict the molecular diffusivity of &quot;nonelectrolyte organic compounds&quot; in water using an artificial neural network-group contribution method. Many of these compounds have ionizable functionalities with pKa values that result in either substantial or effectively complete ionization in water (making them electrolytes, in contrast to the claims of Gharagheizi et al.). Consequently, the model developed and applied by Gharagheizi et al. does not computationally model the actual speciation(s) of each compound expected to be present under the experimental conditions for which the underlying data has been obtained and erroneously classifies many organic compounds as non-electrolytes.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In their article (Cliff et al., J. Sens. Stud., 2011, 26, 184-196), the authors plot the log mean aroma threshold concentrations for three sulfur aroma compound analytes on the y-axis against the qualitative descriptors of the wine (i.e., &quot;model,&quot; &quot;neutral,&quot; and &quot;fruity&quot;) on the x-axis, and proceed to fit three log-linear regression models through the sets of data. The statistical validity of this exercise seems problematic (particularly with only three datapoints, and four significant figures in the resulting quoted regression constants), and the reason behind this choice of data analysis is unclear. Some type of statistical test (e.g., ANOVA) designed to investigate relative trend differences between categorical variables would perhaps be more appropriate, especially when such nebulous categorical descriptors as &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;fruity&quot; are being employed along the x-axis and ordered in an arbitrary manner.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In their study, Wang et al. [Environ. Chem. 2011, 8, 389] use the COSMOtherm software program in an attempt to shed some insights into the physicochemical properties of various poly- and perfluorinated compounds. During the conformation dependent pKa investigations on n-perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the authors appear to make a critical error in their analyses. Wang et al. appear to have allowed a transition from an acid form geometry to a very different anionic form geometry, which is not a correct way of calculating free energy changes during acid dissociation. This error explains why these authors obtained widely ranging conformation dependent pKa values (0.9 to 2.9) for PFOA dissociation. As has been previously shown [Rayne and Forest, J. Mol. Struc. THEOCHEM 2010, 949, 60], there are negligible conformation dependent effects on the pKa value of PFOA.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In their article, Bronner and Goss [Environ. Sci. Technol., 2011, 45, 1307-1312] investigate the pH dependence of organic chemical sorption to soil organic matter. The authors report a log Koc value for benzoyl chloride in aqueous solution, despite this compound having a known hydrolysis half-life of only 16 seconds in water. This timeframe is far too short to allow the measurement of any equilibrium based partitioning coefficients. Consequently, one suspects that the log Koc value reported for benzoyl chloride is likely that of its hydrolysis product: benzoic acid. The authors also may have chosen two experimental conditions (pH 4.5 and 7.2) between which the ionization state of the carboxylic acids in the organic matter may have changed very little, and could instead have remained in effectively the same net ionization state between the two experimental pH endpoints. Thus, there does not appear to be sufficient evidence in this work to support the general claim therein that &quot;protonation/deprotonation of carboxylic groups in humic matter has no significant influence on sorption ... even for polar organic molecules.&quot;</div>

<div class='abstract'>In their article, Charif et al. [J. Mol. Struct.

These authors then examined correlations between their B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) &#916;acidG&#176;(g) values and corresponding experimental aqueous pKa measurements. Large errors are evident between experimental values and the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) calculated &#916;acidG&#176;(g) for propanedioic acid, diethyl ester, dimedone, isopropylidene malonate, barbituric acid, and toluene from this study. The findings call into question the generality of the correlation between &#916;acidG&#176;(g) and aqueous experimental pKa values for carbon acids proposed by Charif et al., and also highlight the need for additional studies to investigate what other carbon acid moieties may be outliers.

<div class='abstract'>In their article, Montero-Campillo et al. [J. Phys. Chem.

A substantial body of work over the past decade has clearly demonstrated the inability of the B3LYP functional (and the majority of other widely employed density functionals) to accurately represent the relative thermodynamic stabilities of linear and branched alkanes (including perhydro, poly- and perhalogenated, and other functionalized derivatives). It has been specifically demonstrated using a range of theoretical methods (semiempirical, Hartree-Fock [HF], various density functionals, and second order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory) that the B3LYP branching error for perhydroalkane isomerizations also applies to perfluoroalkanes, and particularly to classes of compounds such as the 89 PFOS isomers, as well as the perfluoroalkanoic acids and perfluoralkyl sulfonyl/acyl fluorides in their acid and (where applicable) anionic forms. Consequently, the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the molecular acid and anionic PFOS isomers at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory put forward by Montero-Campillo et al. are in substantial error, and the authors and readers are referred elsewhere to more accurate calculations.</div>
