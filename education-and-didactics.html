<div class='abstract'>Reading research papers is integral to computer science education, especially at the graduate and senior undergraduate levels. Students, as well as researchers, spend much time understanding research work. While this is an essential part of computer science education, little work has been done to understand, aid, and formally assess research dissemination processes and methodologies. This short paper summarizes work in progress to build a comprehensive software infrastructure for understanding and disseminating research. The tool distributes various media and files with the research paper that aid in understanding the research paper. It enables researchers to provide documents, videos, media, data, code, etc., related to their research work through a single, well-organized, easy-to-use interface. It allows easy organizing of online discussion groups and research talks to help improve understanding. This short paper summarizes the tool's structure. It highlights the use of the software infrastructure to enhance and formally assess the comprehension, evaluation, and synthesis of research for CS graduate and senior undergraduate students.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Undergraduates in Spanish universities conclude their Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication Engineering with a capstone project. In recent years, students in technical degrees often postpone this last step due to an accelerated entry into the labour market or disappointment about the capstone project development. This article presents an approach which attempts to overcome these challenges: \textit{Engagement} capstone projects. The authors, lecturers in two Spanish Universities (Universidad Polit&#233;cnica de Madrid and Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, supported by the French Company, EOMYS, manage this educational project. Students become responsible for their contribution to a free, libre and open software project, which provides sound quality metrics based on psychoacoustics. They have the opportunity to work in a collaborative and international environment with industrial partners. The presentation of the technological platform shows the educational benefits of the employed tools: Python, GitHub and Jupyter Notebook. A student survey and the supervisors feedback supports an analysis, which helps improve the methodology as well as verify the benefits: better supervision, the development of social and professional skills, and useful community work. Finally, a couple of examples of Engagement capstone projects give insight into the results of this educational strategy.</div>

<div class='title'>Hybrid Learning Aided Technology-Rich Instructional Tools - A Case Study: Community College of Qatar</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/muhammad_jamal_shehab">Muhammad Jamal Shehab</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Educational Institutions have an essential role in promoting the teaching and learning process, within universities, colleges, and communities. Due to the recent coronavirus COVID 19 pandemic, many educational institutions adopted hybrid learning (HL), which is a combination of classic and online learning. It integrates the advantages of both, and it is a fundamental factor to ensure continued learning. Technological innovations such as HL are changing the teaching process, and how students, lecturers, and administrators interact. Based on this, the Community College of Qatar (CCQ) focused on researching the structures and elements related to the adoption of HL. Thus, the goal of this research paper is to reveal the impact of HL on the learning process in CCQ, and the effective didactic tools required for a successful HL program. Our research questions for assessing and evaluating the learning process at CCQ are as follows: a) Is HL a suitable learning strategy that would best suit the students ?; b) What are the didactic tools needed in the HL program at CCQ ?; c) Will the students meet the learning objectives if HL program is adopted?. A quantitative method was used in this study. Furthermore, a questionnaire was designed for the survey which was designed to measure the opinions of the students, instructors, and administrators about the HL program. It is observed from the results that the majority of students, instructors, and administrators showed a positive attitude toward HL, but some had negative views and experienced challenges. The results were analyzed and discussed to better utilize HL to meet the growing demands of the community.</div>

<div class='title'>Interactive STEM Curriculum: Technological Tools and Programming Interface</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/manjukumar_patil">Manjukumar Patil</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/christopher_stewart">Christopher Stewart</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The most important drawback of teaching mathematical equations to the middle school children is the lack of practical examples and interactive tools which can be provided to make concepts easier to grasp. Additionally, on a parallel note, computer programming has become increasingly important in the current era. The amalgamation of programming languages into the STEM curriculum in the early stages of the students&#8217; education would expose them to learn and be acquainted with these concepts at a much earlier age. Teaching STEM concepts using interactive learning tools would benefit students to visualizing the concepts in a more intuitive way. Traditional ways of teaching for linear algebra concepts such as linear equations, quadratic equations, and their associated graphs are not sufficient to reach students deeply with these concepts. However, with the use of technology and right tools (Stepper motor and Drone), we can make the curriculum fun, interactive and link the real-world applications of these concepts, and make students engage deeply into the curriculum.</div>

<div class='title'>Is Science a Pyramid Scheme? the Correlation Between an Author's Position in the Academic Hierarchy and Her Scientific Output Per Year</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/charleeze_p_ponzi">Charleeze P. Ponzi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A grievance expressed by some PhD students and Postdocs is that science works like a pyramid scheme: Young scientists are encouraged to invest into building scientific careers although the chances at remaining in science are extremely slim. This issue is investigated quantitatively by connecting it with the way authorship on papers is distributed. I analyzed a large bibliographic dataset made available by Microsoft under the name Academic Graph to create a histogram with the number of articles an author produces per year. The histogram has the shape of a pyramid, and different layers in it correlate with positions in the academic hierarchy. The super-prolific authors at the top of the pyramid with more than 40 publications per year are usually heads of large institutes with many subgroups and large numbers of PhD students, while the bottom of the pyramid is populated by PhD students and Postdocs with less than 5 publications per year. The mechanism that allows 'manager scientists' to appropriate publications generated in their sphere of influence is related to other issues, such as the evaluation of scientific performance based on scientometric indicators and the lenient enforcement of authorship rules. A new index, the Ponzi factor, is proposed to quantify this phenomenon.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Ben-Naim used twenty question games to illustrate Shannon entropy with base 2 as a measure of the amount of information in terms of the minimum average number of binary questions. We found that Shannon entropy with base 2 equal to the minimum average number of binary questions is only valid under a special condition. The special condition is referred to as the equiprobability condition, which requires that the outcomes of every question have equal probability, thus restricting the probability distribution. This requirement is proven for a ternary game and a proposed multinary game as well. The proposed multinary game &#64257;nds a coin hidden in one of several boxes by using a multiple pan balance. We have shown that the minimum average number of weighing measurements by using the multiple pan balance can be directly obtained by using Shannon entropy with base b under the equiprobability condition. Therefore, Shannon entropy with base b can be interpreted as the minimum average number of weighing measurements by using the multiple pan balance when the multiple outcomes have equal probability every time.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/zion_elani">Zion Elani</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This report presents a simple derivation of Einstein's famous equation, E=mc&#178;. Through the use of elementary physical quantities of Newtonian mechanics such as distance, force, momentum, velocity, and energy, our approach resembles a `handling units' method. Further, two other proofs premising on the notion of mass and its dependence on velocity are discussed. These methods prove to be simple and physically intuitive, thus stimulating the amateur enthusiasts to a better understanding of various complex and difficult-to-derive formulas which are otherwise understood at a sophisticated academic level. Pedagogic significance of these methods is further discussed.</div>

<div class='abstract'>With the rapid surge in technological advancements, an equal amount of investment in technology-embedded teaching has become vital to pace up with the ongoing educational needs. Distance education has evolved from the era of postal services to the use of ICT tools in current times. With the aid of globally updated content across the board, technology usage ensures all students receive equal attention without any discrimination. Importantly, web-based teaching allows all kind of students to learn at their own pace, without the fear of being judged, including professionals who can learn remotely without disturbing their job schedules. Having web-based content allows low-cost and robust implementation of the content upgradation. An improved, yet effective, version of the education using such tools is Hybrid Learning (HL). This learning mode aims to provide luxurious reinforcement to its legitimate candidates while maintaining the quality standards of various elements. Incorporated with both traditional and distance learning methods, along with exploiting social media tools for increased comfort level and peer-to-peer collaboration, HL ultimately facilitates the end user and educational setup. The structure of such a hybrid model is realized by delivering the study material via a learning management system (LMS) designed in compliance with quality standards, which is one of the fundamental tackling techniques for controlling quality constraints. In this paper, we present the recently piloted project by COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT) which is driven by technology-embedded teaching model. This model is an amalgam of the traditional class room model with the aid of state-of-the-art online learning technologies. The students are enrolled as full-time students, with all the courses in traditional classroom mode, except one course offered as hybrid course. This globally adapted model helps the students to benefit from both face-to-face learning as well as gaining hands-on experience on technology-enriched education model providing flexibility of timings, learning pace, and boundaries. Our HL model is equipped with two major synchronous and asynchronous blocks. The synchronous block delivers real-time live interaction scenarios using discussion boards, thereby providing a face-to-face environment. Interactions via social network has witnessed equally surging improvement in the output performance. The asynchronous block refers to the lecture videos, slides and handouts, prepared by imminent professors, available 24/7 for students. To ensure quality output, our HL model follows the course learning outcomes (CLOs), and program learning outcomes (PLOs) as per international standards. As a proof of concept, we have deployed a mechanism at the end of each semester to verify the effectiveness of our model. This mechanism fundamentally surveys the satisfaction levels of all the students enrolled in the HL courses. With the surveys already conducted, a significant level of satisfaction has been noted. Extensive results from these surveys are presented in the paper to further validate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed HL model.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In order to enliven the environment of the physics classroom and deepen the understanding of physics concepts, we propose a ``human'' teaching method that uses the students' bodies themselves as the sole medium to approximately recreate major physical processes. In concrete terms, participants play definite physical roles and assume definite physical functions. All participants form a group and perform the demonstration, thereby recreating major physical processes. We use ``surface tension'' as an example to illustrate this teaching method. This technique increases the interest factor in physics teaching, thus stimulating students' exploratory enthusiasm while cultivating cooperation and team spirit. Therefore, this method is conducive to improving students' collective creative abilities.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The rankings of all kinds are in vogue. They are backed up by the belief that human activity is likely to be measured, each and every institution must advance continuously to improve its position in the ranking. Education and research are some of the activities most affected by the pressure of classification. MIDE of Ministry of Education Colombia; the classification of research groups and researchers by Colciencias; rankings of journals, articles and books; tests Saber, Saber Pro in Colombia; entrance exams to universities; accreditation of &quot;high quality&quot;, qualified registration, curriculum changes, Quality Assurance system... Internationally: The Shanghai rankings type of universities, those of &quot;Impact&quot; of scientific journals, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), The Graduate Record Examination (GRE), PISA Testing, etc. They assume that the intellect can be &quot;measured,&quot; standardized, branded with basis with a unique number that is obtained by &quot;Summing Pears and Apples.&quot; Then the number is used to classify &quot;by descending order of quality&quot; whole institutions, academic programs, research groups and individuals. In this text we discuss the technical impossibility of such pretension, emphasizing the development of a ranking to choose people who deserve to enter the University of Antioquia and discard those who do not deserve it. Seeks to answer the following questions: (1) The system allows an accurate ranking of the candidates, based on the scores? (2) Does the system is accomplished by establishing a solid border between the scores of the admitted and the unsupported? (3) Do the alleged measurements of the intellectual abilities are the only measurements that escape protocols of the science of measurements?</div>

The presence of nested ambiguity in the language of fractions is documented. Careful design of fraction related datatypes and of logics appropriate for such datatypes is proposed as a path towards novel resolution of these complications. The abstract datatype of splitting fractions is informally described. A rationale of its design is provided. A multi-threaded research plan on fractions is outlined.</div>
