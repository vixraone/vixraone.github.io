<div class='abstract'>Although previous studies have established the predictive power of Lotka-Volterra models in financial markets, they assume static demand that does not account for exogenous factors or variable growth rates. The U.S. Domestic Airline industry, however, is an example of a dynamic market that is heavily reliant on customer demand and travel availability, which is why this study introduces non-autonomous models to accurately forecast future growth. Furthermore, only a few firms control most of the market share in this industry, and our study predicts Avelo Airline&#8217;s viability in direct competition with these larger, well-established airlines. Our approach not only studies the behavior of small companies in oligopoly markets, but also provides these firms with a framework to react to the growth rate of market- setters and determine the necessary growth to achieve long term viability in the industry. The model examines several methodologies for financial forecasting into one comprehensive model that enhances the predictive capabilities of Lotka-Volterra models, providing valuable insight for participating firms.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/shumpei_sakuragi">Shumpei Sakuragi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Algorithms by stochastic methods to partial differential equations of the fourth order involving biharmonic operators are stated. The author considered a construction of the solution of a partial differential equation using a certain probability space and stochastic process. There are two algorithms for the fourth-order partial differential equations by stochastic methods. The first one is the method using signed measures. This is a methodwhich constructs a signed measure by a solution using the Fourier transform and obtains a coordinate mapping process. The second method uses iterated Brownian motion. The latter is treated in this paper. The definition ofiterated Brownian motion was modified to investigate the properties of its distribution. The author also defined an iterated random walk corresponding to discretization of that, and showed that it converges to an iteratedBrownian motion in law to the iterated Brownian motion, and obtained its order. In the conventional method, the partial differential equation of the fourth order corresponding to iterated Brownian motion, the Laplacian ofthe boundary condition arises in the remainder term. In other words, if the boundary condition is harmonic, the representation of the partial differential equation involving the biharmonic operator is possible.By focusing on the distribution of the iterated Brownian motion, the representation of the partial differential equation including the biharmonic operator is possible when the boundary condition is biharmonic.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We consider the homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on periodic domain mathbb{T}^{d} with sufficiently small initial datum. For dgeq3 and sgeqfrac{d}{2}-1, the equations are globally wellposed in the energy space L_{t}^{infty}dot{H}_{x}^{s}left(mathbb{R}^{+};mathbb{T}^{d}ight)cap L_{t}^{2}dot{H}_{x}^{s+1}left(mathbb{R}^{+};mathbb{T}^{d}ight) in the critical sense if the initial data u_{0} is divergence free, mean zero and leftVert u_{0}ightVert _{dot{H}_{x}^{s}left(mathbb{T}^{d}ight)} is sufficiently small.

<div class='title'>Motivic Operators and M-Posit Transforms on Spinors</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/parker_emerson">Parker Emerson</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Spinor theory and its applications are indispensable in many areas of theoretical physics, especiallyin quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory. Spinors are complex objects thattransform under specific representations of the Lorentz or rotation groups, capturing the intrinsicspin properties of particles. Recent developments in mathematical abstraction have provided newinsights and tools for exploring spinor dynamics, particularly through the lens of motivic operatorsand M-Posit transforms.This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of spinors subjected to motivic operators and MPosit transforms. Motivic operators encapsulate intrinsic algebraic properties and perturbations,leading to highly evolved spinor states without reliance on external coordinate systems. The M-Posittransform, a novel operator designed for spinors, leverages fractal morphic properties, topologicalcongruence, and quantum-inspired perturbations to manipulate spinor structures within an infinitedimensional oneness geometry calculus.Drawing on the foundations laid by twistor theory, we aim to redefine the evolution of spinorsusing intrinsic properties derived from phenomenological velocity equations. By interpreting spinorsas self-propelled twistors, we offer new perspectives on spinor transformations and dynamics. Thisintrinsic approach not only simplifies the mathematical treatment but also enhances the physicaland geometric interpretation of spinor behaviors.The structure of this paper is organized as follows: We begin with the formal definition andcomputation of spinor components using motivic operators, highlighting the steps involved in theirtransformations. Following this, we introduce the M-Posit transform and explore its applicationto spinors, providing detailed mathematical formulations and examples. We also examine theimplications of these transformations in higher-dimensional twistor spaces and non-commutativestructures. Finally, we extend our analysis to practical applications in quantum computing, fractalimage processing, and quantum field theory.The potential of spinning theory redefined through motivic operators and M-posit transformsoffers promising avenues for further research in various domains of theoretical physics and mathematics. This paper sets a foundation for these explorations, emphasizing the importance of intrinsicproperties and algebraic dynamics in understanding complex spinor evolutions.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper presents an analytic solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flow with a periodic initial velocity vectorfield. Leveraging Fourier series representations, the velocity fields are expressed as expansions, accounting for their temporal evolution.

The proposed solution contributes to understanding fluid dynamics and offers insights into the millennium prize problem related to the Navier-Stokes equations.

<div class='abstract'>The Riemann Hypothesis can be reworded to indicate that the real part of one half always balanced at the infinity tensor by stating that the Riemann zeta function has no more than an infinity tensor&#8217;s worth of zeros on the critical line. For something to be true in proof, it often requires an outside perspective. In other words, there must be some exterior, alternate perspective or system on or applied to the hypothesis from which the proof can be derived. Two perspectives, essentially must agree. Here, a fractal web with infinitesimal 3D strange attractor is theorized as present at the solutions to the Riemann Zeta function and in combination with the infinity tensor yields an abstract, mathematical object from which the rewording of the Riemann Zeta function can be derived. From the rewording, the law that mathematical sequences can be expressed in more concise and manageable forms is applied and the proof is manifested. The mathematical law that any mathematical sequence can be expressed in simpler and more concise terms: &#8704;s&#8707;su2032&#8838;s: &#8704;&#966;: s&#8838;&#966; &#8658; su2032&#8838;&#966;, is the final key to the proof when comparing the real and imaginary parts.

<div class='abstract'>In this note, we will consider some common points of two parallel lines on the plane from the viewpoint of the division by zero calculus. Usually, we will consider that there are no common points or the common point is the point at infinity for two parallel lines. We will, surprisingly, introduce a new common point for two parallel lines from the viewpoint of the division by zero calculus.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We show how the octonion Fourier transform can be embedded and studied in Clifford geometric algebra of three-dimensional Euclidean space Cl(3,0). We apply a new form of dimensionally minimal embedding of octonions in geometric algebra, that expresses octonion multiplication non-associativity with a sum of up to four (individually associative) geometric algebra product terms. This approach leads to new polar representations of octonion analytic signals and signal reconstruction formulas.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/hans_detlef_huttenbach">Hans Detlef H&#252;ttenbach</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper it is shown that the Banach space of continuous, R^2- or C-valued functions on a simply connected either 2-dimensional real or 1-dimensional complex compact region can be decomposed into the topological direct sum of two subspaces, a subspace of integrable (and conformal) functions, and another one of unintegrable (and anti-conformal) functions. It is shown that complex integrability is equivalent to complex analyticity. This can be extended to real functions. The existence of a conjugation on that Banach space will be proven, which maps unintegrable functions onto integrable functions.The boundary of a 2-dimensional simply connected compact region is defined by a Jordan curve, from which it is known to topologically divide the domain into two disconnected regions. The choice of which of the two regions is to be the inside, defines the orientation.The conjugation above will be seen to be the inversion of orientation.Analyticity, integrability, and orientation on R^2 (or C) therefore are intimately related.</div>

<div class='title'>Solving Triangles Algebraically</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/joseph_bakhos">Joseph Bakhos</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Quaterns are a new measure of rotation. Since they are defined in terms of rectangular coordinates, all of the analogue trigonometric functions become algebraic rather than transcendental. Rotations, angle sums and differences, vector sums, cross and dot products, etc., all become algebraic. Triangles can be solved algebraically. Computer algorithms use truncated infinite sums for the transcendental calculations of these quantities. If rotations were expressed in quaterns, these calculations would be simplified by a few orders of magnitude. This would have the potential to greatly reduce computing time. The archaic Greek letter koppa is used to represent rotations in quaterns, rather than the traditional Greek letter theta. Because calculations utilizing quaterns are algebraic, simple rotation in the first two quadrants can be done "by hand" using "pen and paper." Using the approximate methods outlined towards the end of the paper, triangles may be approximately solved with an error of less than 3% using algebra and a few simple formulas.</div>

The packings of the granular material play a very important role in their mechanical behaviors, such as stress-strain response, stability, permeability and so on. Although packing is such an important research topic that its generation has been attracted lots of attentions for a long time in theoretical, experimental, and numerical aspects, packing of granular material is still a difficult and active research topic, especially the generation of random packing of non-spherical particles. To this end, we will generate packings of same particles with same shapes, numbers, and same size distribution using geometry method and dynamic method, separately. Specifically, we will extend one of Monte Carlo models for spheres to ellipsoids and poly-ellipsoids.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Methods approximating the square root of a number use recursive sequences. They do not have a simpleformula for generating the seed value for the approximation, so instead they use various algorithms for choosing the first term of the sequences. Section 1 introduces a new option, based upon the number of digits of the radicand, for selecting the first term. This new option works well at all scales. This first term will then be used in a traditional recursive sequence used to approximate roots. Section 2 will apply the method shown in Section 1 to approximate pi using Archimedes&#8217; method, which then no longer requires different algorithms at different scales for seed values. Section 3 will introduce new recursive sequences for approximating rootsusing Pythagorean triples. Section 4 will then use the same new method to approximate pi.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the past, theorems have shown that individuals can implement a (formal) power series method to derive solutions to algebraic ordinary differential equations, or AODEs. First, this paper will give a quick synopsis of these &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; approaches while further elaborating on a recent theorem that established the (modified) generating function technique, or [m]GFT, as a powerful method for solving differentials equations. Instead of building a (formal) power series, the latter method uses a predefined set of (truncated) Laurent series comprised of polynomial linear, exponential, hypergeometric, or hybrid rings to produce an analytic solution. Next, this study will utilize the [m]GFT to create several analytic solutions to a few example AODEs. Ultimately, one will find [m]GFT may serve as a powerful &quot;top-down&quot; method for solving linear and nonlinear AODEs.</div>

<div class='title'>Seeking the Analytic Quaternion</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/colin_walker">Colin Walker</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>By combining the complex analytic Cauchy-Riemann derivative with the Cayley-Dickson construction of a quaternion, possible formulations of a quaternion derivative are explored with the goal of finding an analytic quaternion derivative having conjugate symmetry. Two such analytic derivatives can be found. Although no example is presented, it is suggested that this finding may have significance in areas of quantum mechanics where quaternions are fundamental, especially regarding the enigmatic phenomenon of complementarity, where a quantum process seems to present two essential aspects.</div>

<div class='title'>Fractional Distance: The Topology of the Real Number Line with Applications to the Riemann Hypothesis</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jonathan_w_tooker">Jonathan W. Tooker</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recent analysis has uncovered a broad swath of rarely considered real numbers called real numbers in the neighborhood of infinity. Here, we extend the catalog of the rudimentary analytical properties of all real numbers by defining a set of fractional distance functions on the real number line and studying their behavior. The main results are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity. We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity with a Cartesian product of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals. We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field. After developing the many underlying foundations, we present a basis for a topology.</div>

<div class='title'>On the State of Convergence of the Flint Hill Series</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/theophilus_agama">Theophilus Agama</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we study the convergence of the flint hill series of the form \begin{align} \sum \limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(\sin^2n) n^3}\nonumber \end{align}via a certain method. The method works essentially by erecting certain pillars sufficiently close to the terms in the series and evaluating the series at those spots. This allows us to relate the convergence and the divergence of the series to other series that are somewhat tractable. In particular we show that the convergence of the flint hill series relies very heavily on the condition that for any small $\epsilon&gt;0$ \begin{align} \bigg|\sum \limits_{i=0}^{\frac{n+1}{2}}\sum \limits_{j=0}^{i}(-1)^{i-j}\binom{n}{2i+1} \binom{i}{j}\bigg|^{2s} \leq |(\sin^2n)|n^{2s+2-\epsilon}\nonumber \end{align}for some $s\in \mathbb{N}$.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Abstract. Quaterns are introduced as a new measure of rotation. Rotation in quaterns has an advantage in that only simple algebra is required to convert back and forth between rectangular and polar coordinates that use quaterns as the angle measure. All analogue trigonometric functions also become algebraic when angles are expressed in quaterns. This paper will show how quatern measure can be easily used to approximate trigonometric functions in the first quadrant without recourse to technology, innite sums, imaginary numbers, or transcendental functions. Using technology, these approximations can be applied to all four quadrants to any degree of accuracy. This will also be shown by approximating u to any degree of accuracy desired without reference to any traditional angle measure at all.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We prove the precompactness of a collection of Borel probability measures over an arbitrary metric space precisely under a new legitimate notion, which we term \textit{topological stationarity}, regulating the sequential behavior of Borel probability measures directly in terms of the open sets. Thus the important direct part of Prokhorov's theorem, which permeates the weak convergence theory, admits a new version with the original and sole assumption --- tightness --- replaced by topological stationarity. Since, as will be justified, our new condition is not vacuous and is logically independent of tightness, our result deepens the understanding of the connection between precompactness of Borel probability measures and metric topologies.</div>

It is, however, not so trivial to assert that the event for every event of the collection to occur is almost sure. Measure theory helps to furnish a simple, definite, and affirmative answer to the question stated in the title. This useful proposition seems to rarely, if not never, occur in a teaching material regarding measure-theoretic probability; our proof in particular would help the beginning students in probability theory to get a feeling of almost sure events.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The invariant subspace problem is a well known unsolved problem in funtional analysis. While many partial results are known, the general case for complex, infinite dimensional separable Hilbert spaces is still open. It has been shown that the problem can be reduced to the case of operators which are norm limits of nilpotents. One of the most important subcases is the one of quasinilpotent operators, for which the problem has been extensively studied for many years. In this paper, we will prove that every quasinilpotent operator has a nontrivial invariant subspace. This will imply that all the operators for which the ISP has not been established yet are norm-limits of operators having nontrivial invariant subspaces.</div>

<div class='title'>Approximation of Harmonic Series</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/aryan_phadke">Aryan Phadke</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Background : Harmonic Series is the sum of Harmonic Progression. There have been multiple formulas to approximate the harmonic series, from Euler's formula to even a few in the 21st Century. Mathematicians have concluded that the sum cannot be calculated, however any approximation better than the previous others is always needed. In this paper we will discuss the flaws in Euler's formula for approximation of harmonic series and provide a better formula. We will also use the infinite harmonic series to determine the approximations of finite harmonic series using the Euler-Mascheroni constant. We will also look at the Leibniz series for Pi and determine the correction factor that Leibniz discussed in his paper which he found using Euler numbers. Each subsequent approximation we find in this paper is better than all previous ones. Different approximations for different types of harmonic series are calculated, best fit for the given type of harmonic series. The correction factor for Leibniz series might not provide any applied results but it is a great way to ponder some other infinite harmonic series.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We define a 2-convex system by the restrictions $x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots + x_{n} = ns$, $e(x_{1}) + e(x_{2}) + \ldots + e(x_{n}) = nk$, $x_{1} \geq x_{2} \geq \ldots \geq x_{n}$ where $e:I \to \RR$ is a strictly convex function. We study the variation intervals for $x_k$ and give a more general version of the Boyd-Hawkins inequalities. Next we define a majorization relation on $A_S$ by $x\preccurlyeq_p y$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $T_k(x) \leq T_k(y) \ \ \forall 1 \leq k \leq p-1$ and $B_k(x) \leq B_k(y) \ \ \forall p+2 \leq k \leq n$ (for fixed $1 \leq p \leq n-1$) where $T_k(x) = x_1 + \ldots + x_k$, $B_k(x) = x_k + \ldots + x_n$. The following Karamata type theorem is given: if $x, y \in A_S$ and $x\preccurlyeq_p y$ then $f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \ldots + f(x_n) \leq f(y_1) + f(y_2) + \ldots + f(y_n)$ $\forall$$f:I \to \RR$ 3-convex with respect to $e$.

<div class='title'>Zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function Within the Critical Strip and Off the Critical Line</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jonathan_w_tooker">Jonathan W. Tooker</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In a recent paper, the author demonstrated the existence of real numbers in the neighborhood of infinity. It was shown that the Riemann zeta function has non-trivial zeros in the neighborhood of infinity but none of those zeros lie within the critical strip. While the Riemann hypothesis only asks about non-trivial zeros off the critical line, it is also an open question of interest whether or not there are any zeros off the critical line yet still within the critical strip. In this paper, we show that the Riemann zeta function does have non-trivial zeros of this variety. The method used to prove the main theorem is only the ordinary analysis of holomorphic functions. After giving a brief review of numbers in the neighborhood of infinity, we use Robinson's non-standard analysis and Eulerian infinitesimal analysis to examine the behavior of zeta on an infinitesimal neighborhood of the north pole of the Riemann sphere. After developing the most relevant features via infinitesimal analysis, we will proceed to prove the main result via standard analysis on the Cartesian complex plane without reference to infinitesimals.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The purpose of this paper is to try to replicate what happens in C on spaces where there are more then one of immaginary units. All these spaces, in our definition, will have the same Hilbert structure. At first we will introduce the sum and product operations on C(H):=RxH (where H is an Hilbert space), then we'll investigate on its algebraic properties. In our construction we lose only the associative of multiplication regardless of H, exept when dim H=1 (in this case RxH = C), and this is why we say &quot;weak extension&quot;. One of the most important result of this study is the Weak Integrity Theorem according to which in particular conditions there exist zero divisors. The next result is the Foundamental Theorem according to which for all z in C(H) there exists w in C(H) such that z=w^2. Afterwards we will study tranformations between these spaces which keep operation (that's why we will call them C-morphisms). At the end we will look at the &quot;commutative&quot; functions, i.e. maps C(H) to C(H') which can be rapresented by complex transformations C to C</div>

It has been demonstrated by Euler that, although the sum diverges, it can be expressed as the Euler-Mascheroni constant added to the natural log of infinity. Utilizing the Euler-Maclaurin method, we can extend the expression to approximate the sum of finite harmonic series with a fixed first term and a variable last term. However, a natural extension is not possible for a variable value of the first term or the common difference of the reciprocals.Aim: The aim of this paper is to create a formula that generates an approximation of the sum of a harmonic progression for a variable first term and common difference. The objective remains that the resultant formula is fundamentally similar to Euler's equation of the constant and the result using the Maclaurin method. Method: The principle result of the paper is derived using approximation theory. The assertion that the graph of harmonic progression closely resembles the graph of y=1/x is key. The subsequent results come through a comparative view of Euler's expression and by using numerical manipulations on the Euler-Mascheroni Constant.Results: We created a general formula that approximates the sum of harmonic progression with variable components. Its fundamental nature is apparent because we can derive the results of the Maclaurin method from our results.</div>

<div class='title'>Unitary Quantum Groups vs Quantum Reflection Groups</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/teo_banica">Teo Banica</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We study the intermediate liberation problem for the real and complex unitary and reflection groups, namely $O_N,U_N,H_N,K_N$. For any of these groups $G_N$, the problem is that of understanding the structure of the intermediate quantum groups $G_N\subset G_N^\times\subset G_N^+$, in terms of the recently introduced notions of ``soft'' and ``hard'' liberation. We solve here some of these questions, our key ingredient being the generation formula $H_N^{[\infty]}=&lt;H_N,T_N^+&gt;$, coming via crossed product methods. Also, we conjecture the existence of a ``contravariant duality'' between the liberations of $H_N$ and of $U_N$, as a solution to the lack of a covariant duality between these liberations.</div>

We show that real numbers in the neighborhood of infinity obey the Archimedes property of real numbers. The main result is an application in complex analysis.

The application of these methods ranges from the ordinary differential equations of order one, to the more general case of systems of m equations of order n. These algorithms are applied to the solution of different physical-mathematical equations. Finally, the corresponding numerical analysis of existence, uniqueness, stability, consistency and convergence is made, mainly for the simplest case of a single ordinary differential equation of the first order.</div>

How to solve the problems of definite solutions which have universal significance for these equations? What are the laws of general solution of the mth-order linear PDEs with n variables (n,m&#8805;2)? Is there any general rule for the solution of a PDE in arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems? Can we obtain the general solution of vector PDEs? Are there very simple methods to quickly and efficiently solve the exact solutions of nonlinear PDEs? And even general solution? Etc.

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, a powerful computational algorithm is developed for the solution of classes of singular second-order, three-point Volterra integrodifferential equations in favorable reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The solutions is represented in the form of series in the Hilbert space W&#8322;&#179;[0,1] with easily computable components. In finding the computational solutions, we use generating the orthogonal basis from the obtained kernel functions such that the orthonormal basis is constructing in order to formulate and utilize the solutions. Numerical experiments are carried where two smooth reproducing kernel functions are used throughout the evolution of the algorithm to obtain the required nodal values of the unknown variables. Error estimates are proven that it converge to zero in the sense of the space norm. Several computational simulation experiments are given to show the good performance of the proposed procedure. Finally, the utilized results show that the present algorithm and simulated annealing provide a good scheduling methodology to multipoint singular boundary value problems restricted by Volterra operator.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eckhard_hitzer">Eckhard Hitzer</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>So far quaternion Fourier transforms have been mainly defined over $\mathbb{R}^2$ as signal domain space. But it seems natural to define a quaternion Fourier transform for quaternion valued signals over quaternion domains. This quaternion domain Fourier transform (QDFT) transforms quaternion valued signals (for example electromagnetic scalarvector potentials, color data, space-time data, etc.) defined over a quaternion domain (space-time or other 4D domains) from a quaternion position space to a quaternion frequency space. The QDFT uses the full potential provided by hypercomplex algebra in higher dimensions and may moreover be useful for solving quaternion partial differential equations or functional equations, and in crystallographic texture analysis. We define the QDFT and analyze its main properties, including quaternion dilation, modulation and shift properties, Plancherel and Parseval identities, covariance under orthogonal transformations, transformations of coordinate polynomials and differential operator polynomials, transformations of derivative and Dirac derivative operators, as well as signal width related to band width uncertainty relationships.</div>

Finally, we prove two theorems about the fundamental operator functions and pose some conjectures. Real operators can give new equations and inequalities so as to precisely describe the relation of mathematical objects or scientific objects.</div>

<div class='title'>On The Leibniz Rule And Fractional Derivative For Differentiable And Non-Differentiable Functions</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/xiong_wang">Xiong Wang</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In the recent paper {\it Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation. Vol.18. No.11. (2013) 2945-2948}, it was demonstrated that a violation of the Leibniz rule is a characteristic property of derivatives of non-integer orders. It was proved that all fractional derivatives ${\cal D}^{\alpha}$, which satisfy the Leibniz rule ${\cal D}^{\alpha}(fg)=({\cal D}^{\alpha}f) \, g + f \, ({\cal D}^{\alpha}g)$, should have the integer order $\alpha=1$, i.e. fractional derivatives of non-integer orders cannot satisfy the Leibniz rule. However, it should be noted that this result is only for differentiable functions. We argue that the very reason for introducing fractional derivative is to study non-differentiable functions. In this note, we try to clarify and summarize the Leibniz rule for both differentiable and non-differentiable functions. The Leibniz rule holds for differentiable functions with classical integer order derivative. Similarly the Leibniz rule still holds for non-differentiable functions with a concise and essentially local definition of fractional derivative. This could give a more unified picture and understanding for Leibniz rule and the geometrical interpretation for both integer order and fractional derivative.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper briefly reviews the notion of Clifford's geometric algebras and vector to multivector functions; as well as the field of Clifford analysis (function theory of the Dirac operator). In Clifford Fourier transformations (CFT) on multivector signals the complex unit $i\in \mathbb{C}$ is replaced by a multivector square root of $-1$, which may be a pseudoscalar in the simplest case. For these transforms we derive, via a multivector function representation in terms of monogenic polynomials, the operator representation of the CFTs by exponentiating the Hamilton operator of a harmonic oscillator.</div>

Second, beginning with the Fourier transform on a scalar function we generalize to a real Fourier transform on GA multivector-valued functions (f : R^3 -&gt; Cl(3,0)). Third, we show a set of important properties of the Clifford Fourier transform (CFT) on Cl(3,0) such as dierentiation properties, and the Plancherel theorem. We round o the treatment of the CFT (at the end of this tutorial) by applying the Clifford Fourier transform properties for proving an uncertainty principle for Cl(3,0) multivector functions. For wavelets in GA it is shown how continuous Clifford Cl(3,0)- valued admissible wavelets can be constructed using the similitude group SIM(3), a subgroup of the ane group of R^3. We express the admissibility condition in terms of the CFT and then derive a set of important properties such as dilation, translation and rotation covariance, a reproducing kernel, and show how to invert the Clifford wavelet transform of multivector functions. We explain (at the end of this tutorial) a generalized Clifford wavelet uncertainty principle. For scalar admissibility constant it sets bounds of accuracy in multivector wavelet signal and image processing.

<div class='title'>The Clifford Fourier Transform in Real Clifford Algebras</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eckhard_hitzer">Eckhard Hitzer</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We use the recent comprehensive research [17, 19] on the manifolds of square roots of -1 in real Clifford&#8217;s geometric algebras Cl(p,q) in order to construct the Clifford Fourier transform. Basically in the kernel of the complex Fourier transform the imaginary unit j in C (complex numbers) is replaced by a square root of -1 in Cl(p,q). The Clifford Fourier transform (CFT) thus obtained generalizes previously known and applied CFTs [9, 13, 14], which replaced j in C only by blades (usually pseudoscalars) squaring to -1. A major advantage of real Clifford algebra CFTs is their completely real geometric interpretation. We study (left and right) linearity of the CFT for constant multivector coefficients in Cl(p,q), translation (x-shift) and modulation (w-shift) properties, and signal dilations. We show an inversion theorem. We establish the CFT of vector differentials, partial derivatives, vector derivatives and spatial moments of the signal. We also derive Plancherel and Parseval identities as well as a general convolution theorem. Keywords: Clifford Fourier transform, Clifford algebra, signal processing, square roots of -1.</div>

Based on the 2D CFT, we establish the two-dimensional Clifford windowed Fourier transform (CWFT). Using the spectral representation of the CFT, we derive several important properties such as shift, modulation, a reproducing kernel, isometry and an orthogonality relation. Finally, we discuss examples of the CWFT and compare the CFT and the CWFT.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We review the quaternionic Fourier transform (QFT). Using the properties of the QFT we establish an uncertainty principle for the right-sided QFT. This uncertainty principle prescribes a lower bound on the product of the effective widths of quaternion-valued signals in the spatial and frequency domains. It is shown that only a Gaussian quaternion signal minimizes the uncertainty.

<div class='abstract'>Rational structure in two dimension means that not only there exists an orthogonal net of curves in the plane but also, for each curve, the stellar density on one side of the curve is in constant ratio to the density on the other side of the curve. Such a curve is called a proportion curve or a Darwin curve. Such a distribution of matter is called a rational structure. Spiral galaxies are blended with dust and gas. Their longer wavelength (e.g. infrared) images present mainly the stellar distribution, which is called the naked galaxies. Jin He found many evidences that galaxies are rational stellar distribution. We list a few examples. Firstly, galaxy components (disks and bars) can be fitted with rational structure. Secondly, spiral arms can be fitted with Darwin curves. Thirdly, rational structure dictates New Universal Gravity which explains constant rotation curves simply and elegantly. This article presents the systematic theory of rational structure, its general solution and geometric meaning. A preliminary application to spiral galaxies is also discussed.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We have not found the general solution to the Creator's equation system. However, we have outlined the strategy for determining the solution. Firstly, we should study the stretch equation which is the first order linear and homogeneous partial differential equation, and find its all stretches which correspond to the given vector field (i.e., the gradient of the logarithmic stellar density). Our solution G(x,y), however, must be simultaneously the modulus of some analytic complex function. It is called the modulus stretch. Secondly, among all possible modulus stretches, we find the right solution (i.e., the orthogonal net of curves) which satisfies the Creator's standard equation.</div>

Numerical results show that the LRBF-FD method has good accuracy as compared with GRBF.</div>

<div class='title'>Fractional Geometric Calculus: Toward A Unified Mathematical Language for Physics and Engineering</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/xiong_wang">Xiong Wang</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper discuss the longstanding problems of fractional calculus such as too many definitions while lacking physical or geometrical meanings, and try to extend fractional calculus to any dimension. First, some different definitions of fractional derivatives, such as the Riemann-Liouville derivative, the Caputo derivative, Kolwankar's local derivative and Jumarie's modified Riemann-Liouville derivative, are discussed and conclude that the very reason for introducing fractional derivative is to study nondifferentiable functions. Then, a concise and essentially local definition of fractional derivative for one dimension function is introduced and its geometrical interpretation is given. Based on this simple definition, the fractional calculus is extended to any dimension and the \emph{Fractional Geometric Calculus} is proposed. Geometric algebra provided an powerful mathematical framework in which the most advanced concepts modern physic, such as quantum mechanics, relativity, electromagnetism, etc., can be expressed in this framework graciously. At the other hand, recent developments in nonlinear science and complex system suggest that scaling, fractal structures, and nondifferentiable functions occur much more naturally and abundantly in formulations of physical theories. In this paper, the extended framework namely the Fractional Geometric Calculus is proposed naturally, which aims to give a unifying language for mathematics, physics and science of complexity of the 21st century.</div>

<div class='title'>Survey on Singularities and Differential Algebras of Generalized Functions :  A Basic Dichotomic Sheaf Theoretic Singularity Test</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/elemer_e_rosinger">Elem&eacute;r E Rosinger</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is shown how the infinity of differential algebras of generalized functions is naturally subjected to a basic dichotomic singularity test regarding their significantly different abilities to deal with large classes of singularities. In this respect, a review is presented of the way singularities are dealt with in four of the infinitely many types of differential algebras of generalized functions. These four algebras, in the order they were introduced in the literature are : the nowhere dense, Colombeau, space-time foam, and local ones. And so far, the first three of them turned out to be the ones most frequently used in a variety of applications. The issue of singularities is naturally not a simple one. Consequently, there are different points of view, as well as occasional misunderstandings. In order to set aside, and preferably, avoid such misunderstandings, two fundamentally important issues related to singularities are pursued. Namely, 1) how large are the sets of singularity points of various generalized functions, and 2) how are such generalized functions allowed to behave in the neighbourhood of their point of singularity. Following such a two fold clarification on singularities, it is further pointed out that, once one represents generalized functions - thus as well a large class of usual singular functions - as elements of suitable differential algebras of generalized functions, one of the main advantages is the resulting freedom to perform globally arbitrary algebraic and differential operations on such functions, simply as if they did not have any singularities at all. With the same freedom from singularities, one can perform globally operations such as limits, series, and so on, which involve infinitely many generalized functions. The property of a space of generalized functions of being a flabby sheaf proves to be essential in being able to deal with large classes of singularities. The first and third type of the mentioned differential algebras of generalized functions are flabby sheaves, while the second type fails to be so. The fourth type has not yet been studied in this regard.</div>
