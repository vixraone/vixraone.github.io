<div class='title'>Prime Gap Instability and the Collapse of the Riemann Hypothesis</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jasmine_burns">Jasmine Burns</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) asserts that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line &#8476;(s) = 1/2. In this paper, we prove that RH is false by demonstrating that the evolution of zeta zeros under the de Bruijn-Newman heat equation is fundamentally unstable. We establish that irregularities in prime gaps introduce an unbounded forcing term in the heat equation, leading to a necessary shift in the location of zeta zeros and forcing &#923; &gt; 0, contradicting RH. Furthermore, we resolve the Pair Correlation Conjecture independently of RH, showing that the statistical structure of zeta zeros remains unchanged under the heat evolution. This result confirms that the known statistical properties of the zeta function are not contingent on RH but instead arise from a deeper structural phenomenon tied to prime number modularity and diffusion dynamics. Our findings necessitate a fundamental reevaluation of the role of RH in analytic number theory, shifting focus toward a more geometrically and dynamically informed understanding of the zeta function's zeros.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Critical Symmetry Theorem transforms number theory by embedding prime distributions within deterministic harmonic periodicities. By enforcing symmetry, it aligns all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function (zeta(s)) on the critical line (Re)(s) = (0.5), resolving the Riemann Hypothesis. The theorem unifies key conjectures, including Twin Primes, Goldbach&#8217;s Conjecture, and bounded prime gaps, as natural consequences of symmetry. This framework bridges chaos and order, reshaping number theory into a deterministic system governed by harmonic principles.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we further develop the theory of circles of partition by introducing the notion of complex circles of partition. This work generalizes the classical framework, extending from subsets of the natural numbers as base sets to partitions defined within the complex plane, which now serves as both the base and bearing set. We employ the expansion principles as central tools for rigorously investigating the possibility to partition numbers with base set as a certain subset of the complex plane.</div>

All columns will have all numbers that add to 2n. Using a sieve, all composites are crossed out and only columns with primes are left. We then define a novel prime decimal system: it gives for every n remainders when n is divided by all primes less than the n. This suggests linear functions, the divisions used can give another perspective on all the column pairs. The inverses of these functions when put into tabular form give symmetries that suggest Goldbach's conjecture is correct.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/bryce_petofi_towne">Bryce Petofi Towne</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line ( Re(s) = frac{1}{2} ) in the complex plane. This paper explores an alternative geometric approach by analyzing the zeta function and its non-trivial zeros in polar coordinates. Transforming the problem into this framework reveals a natural symmetry about the polar axis, which corresponds to the critical line in Cartesian coordinates.We demonstrate that the (Xi(s)) function, a redefined version of the zeta function, retains the symmetry ( Xi(s) = Xi(1 - s) ) in polar coordinates, supporting the hypothesis that non-trivial zeros must lie on the critical line.This geometric perspective suggests a potential simplification in verifying the Riemann Hypothesis and offers new insights into the distribution of non-trivial zeros.</div>

<div class='title'>An Advanced Quantum-Resistant Algorithm: Design, Implementation, and Analysis</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/daniil_krizhanovskyi">Daniil Krizhanovskyi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The advent of quantum computing represents a paradigm shift with profound implications for the field of cryptography. Quantum algorithms, particularly Shor's algorithm, threaten to undermine the security foundations of traditional cryptographic schemes such as RSA, ECC, and DSA, which rely on the computational difficulty of integer factorization and discrete logarithms. As these algorithms become obsolete in the face of quantum capabilities, there is an urgent need for cryptographic systems that can withstand quantum-based attacks. In response to this looming threat, this paper introduces the Quantum Cryptographic Toolkit (QCT), a robust and versatile framework designed to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. The QCT integrates a diverse set of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including lattice-based methods like NewHope, code-based approaches exemplified by the McEliece cryptosystem, and isogeny-based cryptography, such as SIKE. Each of these algorithms is implemented with a focus on maintaining security even in the face of quantum computing advancements, addressing both theoretical and practical challenges. The toolkit is structured to be modular and extensible, allowing researchers and developers to seamlessly incorporate additional algorithms and cryptographic primitives as the field evolves. This paper details the design principles underlying the QCT, emphasizing the importance of modularity, extensibility, and performance optimization. We discuss the implementation strategies employed to ensure the toolkit's effectiveness across a range of cryptographic scenarios, from key exchange protocols to encryption and digital signatures. A comprehensive security analysis is provided, highlighting the resistance of each algorithm to quantum attacks, and comparing their performance to other post-quantum cryptographic solutions. In addition to the security analysis, we include extensive performance benchmarks that evaluate the computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability of the algorithms within the QCT. These benchmarks demonstrate the practical viability of the toolkit for real-world applications, offering insights into the trade-offs between security and performance that are inherent in post-quantum cryptography. The results indicate that the QCT not only meets the stringent security requirements</div>

Numerical simulations further confirm the accuracy and consistency of this geometric approach. And we introduce a formula for the distribution pattern of all non-trivial zeros:[zetaleft(sqrt{frac{1}{4} + t^2} , e^{i arctan(2t)}ight) = 0]where: [r = sqrt{frac{1}{4} + t^2} quad text{and} quad theta = arctan(2t)]</div>

We confirm that using a sieve, we do always seem to get top and bottom primes that show Goldbach's conjecture is true for the particular 2n depicted by this table. Next we cumulatively depict these tables and we see some interesting patterns. We can infer that all prime pairs will occur in one of these tables. We also see diagonal prime lines that seem to start and stop in symmetrical ways. These patterns suggest that for any even number we can choose a column and then find a prime pair.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This document forwards a freshly unearthed test of the Goldbach Conjecture, a longstanding enigma in the theory of numbers put forth byChristian Goldbach in 1742. In our point of view, we have been able to come up with a simple and yet stunning explanation on how numberswhich are divisible by 2 could be permanently expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Through an extensive analysis, it will be seen that every other two numbers above 2 can always be expressed in that manner. Our evidence is based on fundamental theories of numbers and original methods that solve the problem without any difficulty. Consequently, understandingis not difficult at all. The pathway for further research in number theory has just been brought to light while at the same time indicatinghow vital determination and a variation of outlook are for any endeavour.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The paper investigates the dispersion of prime numbers as well as the twin prime and goldbach&#8217;s conjectures. The initial key feature that primenumbers are never even (apart from 2) will be presented as the basis on which a new rule concerning their distribution can be developed. In that wise, this will help us to come up with a demonstration of why there exist an infinite number of odd pairs such that their difference is equal to 2. We also show that the Goldbach conjecture is true. This means that it is possible to write any even number greater than two as the sum of two prime numbers.

<div class='abstract'>Suppose the Riemann Zeta function is multiplied by two arbitrary functions, and the resulting functions' values are equated at symmetrical points concerning the critical line Re s = 1/2. In that case, the resulting system of fourequations has to give the positions of the Zeta function's zeros. However, since the functions are arbitrary, the positions of the zero places are arbitrary, making a zero coincide with non-zero. Hence, the Riemann Hypothesis that the only zeroes are those on the critical line is true. This simple text is proof of the Riemann hypothesis, Generalized Riemann hypothesis and Extended Riemann hypothesis with accordingfunctions.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper presents an approach to analyzing the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function using polar coordinates. We investigate whether the real part of all non-trivial zeros can be determined to be a constant value. By transforming the traditional complex plane into a polar coordinate system, we recalculated and examined several known non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. Our findings provide an alternative framework for understanding this profound mathematical conjecture.Through mathematical proof and leveraging analytic continuation and holomorphic function theory, we explore the nature of (sigma) in the polar coordinate system. This analysis transforms the problem into a geometric one, allowing for simpler and more intuitive calculations. This approach provides a step towards an alternative understanding of the properties of the Riemann zeta function's non-trivial zeros. The findings of this work indicates that wit this geometric perspective, the Riemann Hypothesis holds true.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The objective of this study is to present precise proofs of the Collatz conjecture and introduce some interesting behavior on Kaakuma sequence. We propose a novel approach that tackles the Collatz conjecture using different techniques and angles. The Collatz Conjecture, proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937, remains one of the most intriguing unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture posits that, for any positive integer, applying a series of operations will eventually lead to the number 1. Despite decades of rigorous investigation and countless computational verification, a complete proof has eluded mathematicians. In this research endeavor, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of the Collatz Conjecture, aiming to shed light on its underlying principles and ultimately establish its validity. Our investigation begins by defining the Collatz function and investigating some behavior like. transformation, selective mapping, successive division, constant growth rate of inverse tree, and more. Using and analyzing the discovered properties of Collatz sequence we can show there are contradiction. In addition to this we investigate Qodaa ratio test that validates the reality of discovered behavior of Collatz sequence and works for infinite and distinct Kaakuma sequences. Our investigation culminates in the formulation of a set of conjectures encompassing lemmas and postulates, which we rigorously prove using a combination of analytical reasoning, numerical evidence, and exhaustive case analysis. These results provide compelling evidence for the veracity of the Collatz Conjecture and contribute to our understanding of the underlying mathematical structure. This proof helps to change some researchers' views on unsolved problems and offers new perspectives on probability in infinite range. In this study, we uncover the dynamic nature of the Collatz sequence and provide a reflection and interpretation of the probabilistic proof of the Collatz Conjecture.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the landscape of mathematical inquiry, where the ancient and the modern intertwine, few problems captivate the imagination as profoundly as the Collatz conjecture and the quest for Pythagorean triples. The former, a puzzle that has defied solution since its inception in the 1930s by Lothar Collatz, asks us to consider a simple iterative process: for any positive integer, if it is even, divide it by two; if it is odd, triple it and add one. Despite its apparent simplicity, the conjecture leads us into a labyrinth of diverse complexity, where patterns emerge and dissolve in an unpredictable dance. On the other hand, Pythagorean triples, sets of three integers that satisfy the ancient Pythagorean theorem, have been a cornerstone of geometry since the time of the ancient Greeks, embodying the harmony of numbers and the elegance of spatial relationships. This exploratory paper embarks on an unprecedented journey to bridge these seemingly disparatedomains of mathematics. At the heart of this exploration is the discovery of a novel connection between Collatz dropping times and Pythagorean triples. I will demonstrate how the dropping time of each odd number can be uniquely associated with a Pythagorean triple. As you will see, the triples seem to be encoding spatial information about Collatz trajectories. As we begin to work with triples, we&#8217;ll be motivated to move from the number line to the complex plane where we find structure andbehavior resembling that of the Riemann Zeta function and it&#8217;s zeros.</div>

<div class='title'>Isolating the Prime Numbers</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/adrian_m_stokes">Adrian M. Stokes</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Prime numbers greater than 3 belong to the number sequences 6n &#177; 1 wheren &#8805; 1. These sequences also include the composites that are not divisible by 2 and/or3 and therefore their factors must also be of the form 6n &#177; 1. This allows all of the6n&#177;1 composites to be equivalently written in the form of factors (6n1&#177;1)(6n2&#177;1),where n1 and n2 &#8805; 1, creating three sub-sequences that exclude prime numbers.Finding and isolating the prime numbers can be achieved by selecting a numberrange and creating a set of 6n &#177; 1 numbers for that range before subtracting thesubsets (6n1 &#177; 1)(6n2 &#177; 1) to isolate and identify all the primes in the set.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Intuitively, it seems that Ramanujan's formula $pi^4approx 97.5-1/11$ is an approximation for some perfectly accurate formula for $pi$. Here is one attempt to prove this. The principle of proof, however, is based on closeness of the every rest term to the inverse of integers. Although it is indeed somewhat closer to integers than it is on average, this proof is not complete. So we cannot say for sure whether this proves or disproves that this Ramanujan's formula has higher approximations; however, it gives hints and opens up space for further research.Moreover, this attempted proof is quite original. Also, such a method could also help in physics.</div>

<div class='title'>Validating Collatz Conjecture Through Binary Representation and Probabilistic Path Analysis</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/budee_u_zaman">Budee U. Zaman</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Collatz conjecture, a longstanding mathematical puzzle, posits that, regardless of the starting integer, iteratively applying a specific formula will eventually lead to the value 1. This paper introduces a novelapproach to validate the Collatz conjecture by leveraging the binary representation of generated numbers. Each transition in the sequence is predetermined using the Collatz conjecture formula, yet the path of transitionsis revealed to be intricate, involving alternating increases and decreases for each initial value. The study delves into the global flow of the sequence, investigating thebehavior of the generated numbers as they progress toward the termination value of 1. The analysis utilizes the concept of probability to shed light on the complex dynamics of the Collatz conjecture. By incorporatingprobabilistic methods, this research aims to unravel the underlying patterns and tendencies that govern the convergence of the sequence.The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the Collatz conjecture,offering insights into the inherent complexities of its trajectories. This work not only validates the conjecture through binary representation but also provides a probabilistic framework to elucidate the global flow ofthe sequence, enriching our comprehension of this enduring mathematical mystery.</div>

In so doing [and with Riemann hypothesis being a special case], this action also support the generalized Riemann hypothesis formulated for Dirichlet L-function. By broadly applying Hodge conjecture, Grothendieck period conjecture and Pi-Circle conjecture to Dirichlet eta function (which acts as proxy function for Riemann zeta function), Riemann hypothesis is separately proven to be true when this hypothesis is treated as Incompletely Predictable Problem.</div>

<div class='abstract'>As two different but related infinite-length equations through analytic continuation, Hasse principle is satisfied by Riemann zeta function as a certain type of equation that generates all infinitely-many trivial zeros but this principle is not satisfied by its proxy Dirichlet eta function as a dissimilar type of equation that generates all infinitely-many nontrivial zeros. Based on two seemingly different location that are in fact identical, all nontrivial zeros are mathematically located on critical line or geometrically located on Origin point. Thus we prove location for complete Set nontrivial zeros to be critical line confirming Riemann hypothesis to be true. Sieve of Eratosthenes as a certain type of infinite-length algorithm is exactly constituted by an Arbitrarily Large Number of (self-)similar infinite-length sub-algorithms that are specified by every even Prime gaps. Modified Hasse principle is satisfied by this algorithm and its sub-algorithms that perpetually generate the Arbitrarily Large Number of all Odd Primes. Thus we prove Set even Prime gaps with corresponding Subsets Odd Primes all have cardinality Arbitrarily Large in Number confirming Modified Polignac's and Twin prime conjectures to be true.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We study the distribution of superprimes, a subsequence of prime numbers with prime indices, mod 4. Rather unexpectedly, this subsequenceexhibits a reverse Chebyshev bias: terms of the form 4k + 1 are more common than those of the form 4k + 3, whereas the opposite is the case in the sequence of all primes. The effect, while initially weak and easy to overlook, tends tobe several times larger than the Chebyshev bias for all primes for samples of comparable size, at least, by one simple measure. By two other measures, it can be seen as fairly strong; by the same measures the ordinary Chebyshev effectis very strong. Both of these measures also imply that the reverse Chebyshev bias for superprimes is more volatile than the ordinary Chebyshev bias.</div>

<div class='title'>The Philosophical and Mathematical Implications of Division by 0/0 = 1 in Light of Einstein&#8217;s Theory of Special Relativity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/budee_u_zaman">Budee U. Zaman</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The enigma of dividing zero by zero 0 0 has perplexed scholars across philosophy, mathematics, and physics, remaining devoid of a clear-cut solution. This lingering conundrum leaves us in an unsatisfactory position,as there emerges a genuine necessity for such divisions, particularly in scenarios involving tensor components that are both set at zero. This article endeavors to grapple with this profound issue by leveraging the insights of Einstein&#8217;s theory of special relativity. Surprisingly, when we wholeheartedly embrace the ramifications of this theory, it becomes evidentthat zero divided by zero must equate to one 00 = 1. Essentially, we are confronted with a pivotal decision: either embrace the feasibility and definition of dividing zero by zero, in accordance with Einstein&#8217;s theory of special relativity, or reevaluate the integrity of this fundamental theory itself. This exploration delves into the profound consequences arisingfrom this critical choice.</div>

<div class='title'>The Geometric Collatz Correspondence</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/darcy_thomas">Darcy Thomas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Collatz Conjecture, one of the most renowned unsolved problems in mathematics, presents adeceptive simplicity that has perplexed both experts and novices. Distinctive in nature, it leaves manyunsure of how to approach its analysis. My exploration into this enigma has unveiled two compellingconnections: firstly, a link between Collatz orbits and Pythagorean Triples; secondly, a tie to theproblem of tiling a 2D plane. This latter association suggests a potential relationship with PenroseTilings, which are notable for their non-repetitive plane tiling. This quality, reminiscent of theunpredictable yet non-repeating trajectories of Collatz sequences, provides a novel avenue to probethe conjecture&#8217;s complexities. To clarify these connections, I introduce a framework that interpretsthe Collatz Function as a process that maps each integer to a unique point on the complex plane.In a curious twist, my exploration into the 3D geometric interpretation of the Collatz Function has nudged open a small, yet intriguing door to a potential parallel in the world of physics. A subtle link appears to manifest between the properties of certain objects in this space and the atomic energy spectral series of hydrogen, a fundamental aspect in quantum mechanics. While this connection is in its early stages and the depth of its significance is yet to be fully unveiled, it subtly implies a simple merging where pure mathematics and applied physics might come together.The findings in this paper have led me to pursue development of a new type of number I call a Cam number, which stands for "complex and massive", indicating that it is a number with properties that on one hand act like a scalar, but on the other hand act as a complex number. Cam numbers can be thought of as having somewhat dual identities which reveal their properties and behavior under iterations of the Collatz Function. This paper serves as a motivator for a pursuit of a theory of Cam numbers.</div>

This unified criterion offers a promising approach to twin prime identification within a wider range of integers, further advancing research in this mathematical domain.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The "strong Goldbach conjecture" posits that any even number exceeding 6 can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers. This study explores this hypothesis, leveraging the constancy of odd integer quantities and cumulative sums within positive integers. By identifying odd prime numbers, p&#945;1and p&#945;2, within [3, n] and (n, 2n-2) intervals, we demonstrate a transformative process grounded in the unchanging nature of odd number counts and their cumulative sums. Through this process, we establish the equation 2n =p&#945;1 + p&#945;2, offering a significant stride in unraveling the enigmatic core of the strong Goldbach conjecture.</div>

The scope of the beauty side is similar: a proposed sequence that is opposite to the primes in some sense, finite sequences with peculiar properties, Fibonacci-like sequences, trees of primitive Pythagorean triples, Babylonian math, Grimm's conjecture, and Shell sort.

Furthermore, we navigate the intricate relationship betweenthe infinite and fundamental scientific questions, seeking to unveil novel insights and resolutions. In a departure from conventional viewpoints,our examination of natural number infinity takes on a relativistic dimension, scrutinizing the role of time and the observer&#8217;s perspective. Strikingly, as we delve deeper into the foundational strata, we uncover the pivotal significance of relativity not only in physics but also in mathematics.

<div class='abstract'>This paper introduces a novel approach to estimating the distribu- tion of prime numbers by leveraging insights from partition theory, prime number gaps, and the angles of triangles. Application of this methodology to infinite sums and nth terms, and propose several ways of defining the nth term of a prime number. By using the Ramanujan infinite series of natural numbers, I am able to derive an infinite series of prime numbers value . Overall, this work represents a significant contribution to the field of prime number theory and sheds new light on the relationship between prime numbers and other mathematical concepts.</div>

<div class='title'>Irrationality of Pi Using Just Derivatives</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/timothy_w_jones">Timothy W. Jones</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The quest for an irrationality of pi proof that can be incorporated into an analysis (or a calculus) course is still extant. Ideally a proof would be well motivated and use in an interesting way the topics of such a course. In particular $e^{pi i}$ should be used and the more easily algebraic of derivatives and integrals -- i.e. derivatives. A further worthy goal is to use techniques that anticipate those needed for other irrationality and, maybe even, transcendence proofs. We claim to have found a candidate proof.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/rudi_mayers">Rudi Mayers</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>It is well known to mathematicians, that there is an infinite number of primes as proven via simple logic by Euclid in the 4th Century BC1,2 and confirmed by Leonhard Euler in 17373. In 1846 French mathematician Alphonse de Polignac4 proposed that any even number can be expressed in infinite ways as the difference between two consecutive primes, since when or perhaps possibly even before that all the way back to Euclid, mathematicians have been trying to prove that there is an infinite number of TWIN PRIMES. In this paper a relatively simple proof is presented, that there is indeed an infinity of TWIN PRIMES based on a new approach without any assumptions.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The paper analyzes the number of zeros in the binary representation of a natural number. The analysis is carried out using the concept of the fractional part of a number, which naturally arises when finding a binary representation. This idea relies on the fundamental property of the Riemann zeta function, which is constructed using the fractional part of a number. Understanding that the ratio of the fractional and integer parts, by analogy with the Riemann zeta function, expresses the deep laws of numbers, will explain the essence of this work. For the Syracuse sequence of numbers that appears in the Collatz conjecture, we use a binary representation that allows us to obtain a uniform estimate for all terms of the series, and this estimate depends only on the initial term of the Syracuse sequence. This estimate immediately leads to the solution of the Collatz conjecture</div>

To fully understand the meaning of numbers, we have to maintain their natural form which is a quotient of a value to a reference measure. Only by keeping this form we can do mathematics properly and appreciate its natural beauty.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/aric_b_canaanie">Aric B. Canaanie</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The central idea of this article is to introduce and prove a special form of the zeta function as proof of Riemann&#8217;s last theorem. The newly proposed zeta function contains two sub-functions, namely f1(b,s) and f2(b,s) . The unique property of zeta(s)=f1(b,s)-f2(b,s) is that as tends toward infinity, the equality zeta(s)=zeta(1-s) is transformed into an exponential expression for the zeros of the zeta function. At the limiting point, we simply deduce that the exponential equality is satisfied if and only if real(s)=1/2. Consequently, we conclude that the zeta function cannot be zero if real(s)=1/2, hence proving Riemann&#8217;s last theorem.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper offers a breakthrough in proving the veracity of original Riemann hypothesis, and extends the validity of its method to include the cases of the Dedekind zeta functions, the Hecke L-functions hence the Artin L-functions, and the Selberg class.First we parametrize the Riemann surface $mathbf{S}$ of $log$-function, with which we first shrink the scale of each chosen parameter for which it depends on the chosen natural number $Q_{N_{0}}$ which is a chosen common multiple of all the denominators which are derived from a pre-set choice of rational numbers which approximate the values $log(k+1)$ with the integers $k$ in $0leq kleq N$.Then in (1.7) we define the mapping $-Q_{N_{0}}log(.)$ to pull the truncated Dirichlet $eta$-function $f_{N}(s)$ back to be re-defined on $mathbf{S}$, after that we shrink all the points to have their absolute values are all less than $1$ and closer to $1$. We apply the Euler transformation to the alternative series of Dirichlet $eta$-functions $f(s)$ which are defined in (1.4), then we build up the locally uniform approximation of Theorem 4.7 for $f(s)$ which are established on any given compact subset contained in the right half complex plane.In the second part we define the functions $phi(s)$ which are formulated in (6.1) then by specific property of the functions $phi(s)$, we have the similar asymptotics Theorem 6.5 as those of Theorem 4.7 to obtain the result of Theorem 6.8.And with the locally uniform estimation Lemma 5.10, finally in Theorem 5.9 and Theorem 6.9 we employ Theorem 5.8 and Theorem 6.8 to solve problems of Riemann hypothesis for the Dedekind zeta functions, the Hecke L-functions, the Artin L-functions, and the Selberg class for which all of their nontrivial zeros are contained in the vertical line $Re(s)=1/2$.Finally for the $gamma(s)$-factor of each Dirichlet series $D(s)$ which is formulated in (1.4), then by Theorem 6.9 it has neither zeros nor poles contained in the critical strip $0&lt;Re(s)&lt;1$ and the non-existence of Siegel's zeros for such Dirichlet series $D(s)$ is confirmed.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We give a new approach to the question of whether or not all greater than one, integer arguments of Zeta are irrational. Currently only Zeta(2n) and Zeta(3) are known to be irrational. We show that using the denominators of the terms of Zeta(n)-1=z_n as decimal bases gives all rational numbers in (0,1) as single decimals, property one. We also show the partial sums of z_n are not given by such single digits so using the denominators of the partial sum's terms as number bases, property two. Next, using integrals for the p-series contracting upper and lower bounds for partial sum remainders of z_n are generated. Assuming z_n is rational, it is expressible as a single decimal using the denominator of a term of z_n (property one) and eventually these bounds will consist of infinite decimals (property two) with their first decimal equal to this single decimal. But as no single decimal can be between two infinite decimals with the same first digit a contradiction is derived and all z_n are proven irrational.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A multidimensional number will not be viewed as a single real scalar value, rather,as a set of scalar values, each associated with a dimension. This gives rise to variations of"complex numbers", and consequently, Euler&#8217;s formula. The properties of complex numbers,such as the product of magnitudes being equal to the magnitude of the products, may also beapplicable in the case of multidimensional numbers, depending on how they are constructed.Although similar ideas exist, such as a hypercomplex number, the differences will be discussed.</div>

<div class='title'>Collatz Conjecture: An Order Machine</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/michael_williams">Michael Williams</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Collatz conjecture (3n+1 problem) is an application of Cantor's isomorphism theorem (Cantor-Bernstein) under recursion. The set of 3n+1 for all odd positive integers n, is an order isomorphism for (odd X, 3X+1). The other (odd X, 3X+1) linear order has been discovered as a bijective order-embedding, with values congruent to powers of four. This is demonstrated using a binomial series as a set rule, then showing the isomorphic structure, mapping, and cardinality of those sets. Collatz conjecture is representative of an order machine for congruence to powers of two. If an initial value is not congruent to a power of two, then the iterative program operates the (odd X, 3X+1) order isomorphism until an embedded value is attained. Since this value is a power of four, repeated division by two tends the sequence to one. Because this same process occurs, regardless of the initial choice for a positive integer, Collatz conjecture is true.</div>

<div class='title'>Every Sufficiently Large Even Number Is the Sum of Two Primes</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ricardo_g_barca">Ricardo G. Barca</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The binary Goldbach conjecture asserts that every even integer greater than $4$ is the sum of two primes. In this paper, we prove that there exists an integer $K_\alpha &gt; 4$ such that every even integer $x &gt; p_k^2$ can be expressed as the sum of two primes, where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number and $k &gt; K_\alpha$. To prove this statement, we begin by introducing a type of double sieve of Eratosthenes as follows. Given a positive even integer $x &gt; 4$, we sift from $[1, x]$ all those elements that are congruents to $0$ modulo $p$ or congruents to $x$ modulo $p$, where $p$ is a prime less than $\sqrt{x}$. Therefore, any integer in the interval $[\sqrt{x}, x]$ that remains unsifted is a prime $q$ for which either $x-q = 1$ or $x-q$ is also a prime. Then, we introduce a new way of formulating a sieve, which we call the sequence of $k$-tuples of remainders.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/andrea_prunotto">Andrea Prunotto</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this work, we introduce the concept of Fermat&#8217;s Urn, an urn containing three types of marbles, and such that it holds a peculiar constraint therein: The probability to get at least one marble of a given type (while performing multiple independent drawings) is equal to the probability not to get any marble of another type. Further, we discuss a list of implicit hypotheses related to Fermat's Equation, which would allow us to interpret this equation exactly as the mentioned constraint in Fermat's Urn. Then, we study the properties of this constraint in relation with the capability to distinguish the types of marbles within the urn, namely in case of the event ''to get at least one marble of each type''. Eventually, on the basis of a simple theorem related to this event, we prove that Fermat's Equation and Fermat's Urn may share those properties only if we perform at most two drawings from the urn. This result reflects then in the solution of Fermat's Equation.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/waldemar_puszkarz">Waldemar Puszkarz</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Computer experiments show that singly even multiples of 6 sur-rounded by prime pairs exhibit a larger ratio of nonsquarefree to squarefree multiples than generic singly even multiples of 6, a bias of ca 10.6% measured against the expected value. The same bias occurs for isolated primes next to singly even multiples of 6; here the deviation from the expected value is ca 3.3% of this value. The expected value of the ratio of singly even to doubly even nonsquarefree multiples of 6 also differs from values found experimentally for prime pairs centered on such multiples or isolated primes next to them. For pairs, this ratio exceeds its unbiased value by ca 6.2%, for isolated primes by ca 2.0%. The values cited are for the first 10^10 primes, the largest range we investigated. This paper broadens our recent study of a newly found bias in the distribution of primes by examining singly and doubly even multiples of 6. In particular, it shows that for primes centered on or next to singly even multiples of 6, the statistical biases in question are more pronounced than in the general case studied by us before.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The central idea of this article is to introduce and prove a special form of the zeta function as proof of Riemann&#8217;s last theorem. The newly proposed zeta function contains two sub functions, namely f1(b,s) and f2(b,s) . The unique property of zeta(s)=f1(b,s)-f2(b,s) is that as tends toward infinity the equality zeta(s)=zeta(1-s) is transformed into an exponential expression for the zeros of the zeta function. At the limiting point, we simply deduce that the exponential equality is satisfied if and only if real(s)=1/2 . Consequently, we conclude that the zeta function cannot be zero if real(s)=1/2 , hence proving Riemann&#8217;s last theorem.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A new relation between the Lerch's transcendent, $\Phi$, and the Hurwitz zeta, $\zeta(k,b)$, at the positive integers is introduced. It is derived simply by inverting the relation presented in the precursor paper with one of two approaches (its generating function or the binomial theorem). This enables one to go from Lerch as a function of Hurwitz zetas (of different orders), to Hurwitz as a function of Lerches. A special case of this new functional equation is a relation between the Riemann's zeta function and the polylogarithm.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper discusses a few main topics in Number Theory, such as the M\&quot;{o}bius function and its generalization, leading up to the derivation of a neat power series for the prime counting function, $\pi(x)$. Among its main findings, we can cite the extremely useful inversion formula for Dirichlet series (given $F_a(s)$, we know $a(n)$, which may provide evidence for the Riemann hypothesis, and enabled the creation of a formula for $\pi(x)$ in the first place), and the realization that sums of divisors and the M\&quot;{o}bius function are particular cases of a more general concept. One of its conclusions is that it's unnecessary to resort to the zeros of the analytic continuation of the zeta function to obtain $\pi(x)$.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jose_r_sousa">Jose R. Sousa</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>At the negative integers, there is a simple relation between the Lerch $\Phi$ function and the polylogarithm. The literature has a formula for the polylogarithm at the negative integers, which utilizes the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Starting from that formula, we can deduce a simple closed formula for the Lerch $\Phi$ function at the negative integers, where the Stirling numbers are not needed. Leveraging that finding, we also produce alternative formulae for the $k$-th derivatives of the cotangent and cosecant (ditto, tangent and secant), as simple functions of the negative polylogarithm and Lerch $\Phi$, respectively, which is evidence of the importance of these functions (they are less exotic than they seem). Lastly, we present a new formula for the Hurwitz zeta function at the positive integers using this novelty.</div>

<div class='abstract'>I present a method to solve the general cubic polynomial equation based on six years of research that started back in 1985 when, in the fifth grade, I first learned of Bhaskara's formula for the quadratic equation. I was fascinated by Bhaskara's formula and naively thought I could replicate his method for the third degree equation, but only succeeded in 1990, after countless failed attempts. The solution involves a simple transformation to form a cube and which, by chance, happens to reduce the degree of the equation from three to two (which seems to be the case of all polynomial equations that admit solutions by means of radicals). I also talk about my experiences trying to communicate these results to mathematicians, both at home and abroad.</div>

We do this in three stages by turns; one is &#8216;Application Principle of Mathematical Induction&#8217;, another is &#8216;Proof of Twin prime conjecture&#8217; and the other is &#8216;Proof of Goldbach&#8217;s conjecture&#8217;. These three proofs are interconnected, so they help prove it. Proofs of Twin prime conjecture and Goldbach&#8217;s conjecture are proved by Application Principle of Mathematical Induction. And Twin prime conjecture is based on Goldbach&#8217;s conjecture. So, we can get the result, Twin prime and Goldbach&#8217;s conjecture are true. The reason why we could get the result is that I use twin prime&#8217;s characteristic that difference is 2 and apply this with Application Principle of Mathematical Induction. If this is proved in this way, It implies that the problem can be proved in a new way of proof.</div>

<div class='title'>Riemann Hypothesis Proof Using an Equivalent Criterion of Balazard, Saias and Yor</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/shekhar_suman">Shekhar Suman</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this manuscript we denote a unit disc by $\mathbb{D}=\{z\in \mathbb{C} \mid |z|&lt;1\}$ and a semi plane as\\ $\mathbb{P}=\{s\in\mathbb{C}\mid \Re(s)&gt;\frac{1}{2}\}$. We denote, $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}=\{x\in \mathbb{R}\mid x\geq 0\}$ and $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 1}=\{x\in \mathbb{R}\mid x\geq 1\}$. Considering non negative real axis as a branch cut, we define a map from slit unit disc to the slit plane as $s:\mathbb{D}\setminus \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\to \mathbb{P}\setminus\mathbb{R}_{\geq 1}$ defined as $s(z)=\frac{1}{1-\sqrt{z}}$ which is proved to be one-one and onto. Next, we define a function $f(z)=(s-1)\zeta(s)$ where $s=s(z)$ and both $s(z)$ and $f(z)$ are proved to be analytic in $\mathbb{D}\setminus \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Next we prove that $s=s(z)$ is a conformal map. We also show that $f$ is continuous at $0$. Using Cauchy's residue theorem to a keyhole contour and Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem along with Schwarz reflection principle, we prove that, $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\log|\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it)|}{\frac{1}{4}+t^2}dt=0$$ This settles the Riemann Hypothesis because this relation is an equivalent version of Riemann Hypothesis as proved by Balazard, Saias and Yor [1].</div>

That implies the validity of the Twin Prime Conjecture. On the other hand, the existence of strictly increasing chains of subbasic open sets shows that the Polignac Conjecture is false for an infinity of cases.</div>

<div class='title'>Irrationality Proofs: From e to Zeta(n&gt;=2)</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/timothy_w_jones">Timothy W. Jones</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We develop definitions and a theory for convergent series that have terms of the form $1/a_j$ where $a_j$ is an integer greater than one and the series convergence point is less than one. These series have terms with denominators that can be used as number bases. The series for $e-2$ and $z_n=\zeta(n)-1$ are of this type. Further, both series yield number bases that can represent all possible rational convergence points as single digits. As partials for these series are rational numbers, all partials can be given as single decimals using some $a_j$ as a base. In the case of $e-2$, the last term of a partial yields such a base and partials form systems of nesting inequalities yielding a proof of the irrationality of $e-2$. Using limits in an unusual way we are able to give a second proof for the irrationality of $e-2$. A third proof validates the second using Dedekind cuts. In the case of $z_n$, using the $z_2$ case we determine that such systems of nesting inequalities are not formed, but we discover partials require bases greater than the denominator of their last term. We prove this property for the general $z_n$ case and, using the unusual limit style proof mentioned, prove $z_n$ is irrational. We once again validate the proof using Dedekind cuts. Finally, we are able to give what we consider a satisfying proof showing why both $e-2$ and $z_n$ are irrational.</div>

Computed as Information-based complexity, our innovative Information-complexity conservation constitutes a unique all-purpose analytic tool associated with Mathematics for Incompletely Predictable problems. These problems are literally &quot;complex systems&quot; containing well-defined Incompletely Predictable entities such as nontrivial zeros and two types of Gram points in Riemann zeta function (or its proxy Dirichlet eta function) together with prime and composite numbers from Sieve of Eratosthenes. Correct and complete mathematical arguments for first key step of converting this function into its continuous format version, and second key step of using our unique Dimension (2x - N) system instead of this Sieve result in primary spin-offs from first key step consisting of providing proof for Riemann hypothesis (and explaining closely related two types of Gram points), and second key step consisting of providing proofs for Polignac's and Twin prime conjectures.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/p_g_bass">P.G. Bass</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper provides a simple proof of Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem via elementary algebraic analysis of a level that would have been extant in Fermat&#8217;s day, the mid seventeenth century. The proof is effected by transforming Fermat's equation to an nth order polynomial, which is solved for 5 cases revealing a pattern that enables an extrapolation to the general case.</div>

<div class='title'>The Collatz Conjecture and the Quantum Mechanical Harmonic Oscillator</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/ramon_carbo-dorca">Ramon Carbo-Dorca</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>By establishing a dictionary between the QM harmonic oscillator and the Collatz process, it reveals very important clues as to why the Collatz conjecture most likely is true. The dictionary requires expanding any integer $ n $ into a binary basis (bits) $ n = \sum a_{nl} 2^l $ ($l$ ranges from $ 0 $ to $ N - 1$) that allows to find the correspondence between every integer $ n $ and the state $ | \Psi_n \rangle $, obtained by a superposition of bit states $ | l \rangle $, and which are related to the energy eigenstates of the QM harmonic oscillator. In doing so, one can then construct the one-to-one correspondence between the Collatz iterations of numbers $ n \rightarrow { n \over 2 }$ ($n$ even); $ n \rightarrow 3 n + 1$ ($n$ odd) and the operators $ {\bf L}_{ { n \over 2} }; { \bf L}_{ 3 n + 1 } $, which map $ \Psi_n $ to $ \Psi_{ { n \over 2 } }$, or to $ \Psi_{ 3 n + 1 } $, respectively, and which are constructed explicitly in terms of the creation $ {\bf a}^\dagger$, annihilation $ {\bf a }$, and unit operator $ { \bf 1 } $ of the QM harmonic oscillator. A rigorous analysis reveals that the Collatz conjecture is most likely true, if the composition of a chain of $ {\bf L}_{ { n \over 2} }; { \bf L}_{ 3 n + 1 } $ operators (written as $ L_*$ in condensed notation) leads to the null-eigenfunction conditions $ ( {\bf L_* L_* \ldots L_* } - {\cal P } ) \Psi_n = 0 $, where $ {\cal P} $ is the operator that $projects$ any state $ \Psi_n $ into the ground state $ \Psi_1 \equiv | 0 \rangle $ representing the zero bit state $ | 0 \rangle$ (since $2^0 = 1$). In essence, one has a realization of the integer/state correspondence typical of QM such that the Collatz paths from $ n $ to $ 1$ are encoded in terms of quantum transitions among the states $ \Psi_n$, and leading effectively to an overall downward cascade to $ \Psi_1$. The QM oscillator approach explains naturally why the Collatz conjecture fails for negative integers because there are no states below the ground state.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jeet_kumar_gaur">Jeet Kumar Gaur</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper presents a new approach towards the Riemann Hypothesis. On iterative expansion of integration term in functional equation of the Riemann zeta function we get sum of two series function. At the &#8216;nontrivial&#8217; zeros of zeta function, value of the series is zero. Thus, Riemann hypothesis is false if that happens for an &#8216;s&#8217; off the line &lt;(s) = 1/2 ( the critical line). This series has two components f(s) and f(1 &#8722; s). For the hypothesis to be false one component is additive inverse of the other. From geometric analysis of spiral geometry representing the component series functions f(s) and f(1 &#8722; s) on complex plane we find by contradiction that they cannot be each other&#8217;s additive inverse for any s, off the critical line. Thus, proving truth of the hypothesis.</div>

The limit of the partials is zn and the limit of the exclusions leaves only irrational numbers. Thus zn is proven to be irrational.</div>

Residual nestedness reveals increasing polynomial intertwining and shows scale invariance, or at least strong self-similarity up to at least p = 15,485,863. Accuracy of prediction decreases as the prediction range increases, conversely, the increase in the number of models helps refine predictions holistically.</div>

<div class='title'>The Super-Generalised Fermat Equation Pa^x + Qb^y=rc^z and Five Related Proofs</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/julian_beauchamp">Julian Beauchamp</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we consider five proofs related to the super-generalised Fermat equation, Pa^x + Qb^y=Rc^z. All proofs depend on a new identity for a^x + b^y which can be expressed as a binomial sum to an indeterminate power, z. We begin with the Generalised Fermat Conjecture, for the case P,Q,R=1, also known as the Tijdeman-Zagier Conjecture and Beal Conjecture. We then show how the method applies to its famous corollary Fermat's Last Theorem, where x,y,z=n. We then return to the title equation, considered by Henri Darmon and Andrew Granville and extend the proof for the case P,Q,R&gt;1 and x,y,z&gt;2. Finally, we use the results to prove Catalan's Conjecture, and from this a weak proof that under certain conditions only one solution exists for equations of the form a^4-c^2=b^y.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper we introduce and develop the circle embedding method. This method hinges essentially on a Combinatorial structure which we choose to call circles of partition. We provide applications in the context of problems relating to deciding on the feasibility of partitioning numbers into certain class of integers. In particular, our method allows us to partition any sufficiently large number $n\in\mathbb{N}$ into any set $\mathbb{H}$ with natural density greater than $\frac{1}{2}$. This possibility could herald an unprecedented progress on class of problems of similar flavour. The paper finishes by giving a partial proof of the binary Goldbach conjecture.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Under the assumption that $\sum \limits_{n\leq N}\Upsilon(n)\Upsilon(N-n)&gt;0$, we show that for all even number $N&gt;6$ \begin{align} \sum \limits_{n\leq N}\Upsilon(n)\Upsilon(N-n)=(1+o(1))K\sum \limits_{p|N}\sum \limits_{\substack{n\leq N/p}}\Lambda_{0}(n)\Lambda_{0}(N/p-n)\nonumber \end{align}for some constant $K&gt;0$, and where $\Upsilon$ and $\Lambda_{0}$ denotes the master and the truncated Von mangoldt function, respectively. Using this estimate, we relate the Goldbach problem to the problem of showing that for all $N&gt;6$ $(N\neq 2p)$, If $\sum \limits_{p|N}\sum \limits_{\substack{n\leq N/p}}\Lambda_{0}(n)\Lambda_{0}(N/p-n)&gt;0$, then $\sum \limits_{\substack{n\leq N/p}}\Lambda_{0}(n)\Lambda_{0}(N/p-n)&gt;0$ for each prime $p|N$.</div>

<div class='title'>Bounds on the Range(s) of Prime Divisors of a Class of Baillie-PSW Pseudo-Primes</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dhananjay_phatak">Dhananjay  Phatak</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In the literature [1], Carmichael Numbers that satisfy additional constraints $(p+1) \mydivides (N+1)$ for every prime divisor $p \mydivides N$ are referred to as ``Williams' Numbers''\footnote{more precisely, ``1-Williams Numbers''~; however~; the distinctions between different types of Willliams' numbers are not relevant in this document and therefore, we refer to 1-Williams Numbers~ simply as Williams' numbers.}. % In the renowned Pomerance-recipe~\cite{pomerance1984there} to search for Baillie-PSW pseudoprimes; there are heuristic arguments suggesting that the number of Williams' Numbers could be large (or even unlimited). Moreover, it is shown~\cite{pomerance1984there} that if a Williams' number is encountered during a search in accordance with all of the conditions in that recipe~\cite{pomerance1984there}~; then it must also be a Baillie-PSW pseudoprime. We derive new analytic bounds on the prime-divisors of a Williams' Number.\\ Application of the bounds to Grantham's set of 2030 primes~(see ~\cite{grantham-620-list}) drastically reduces the search space from the impossible size $\approx 2^{(2030)}$ to less than a quarter billion cases (160,681,183 cases to be exact, please see the appendix for details). We tested every single case in the reduced search space with maple code. The result showed that there is \underline{NO Williams' number (and therefore NO Baillie-PSW pseudo-prime which is also a Williams' number)} in the entire space of subsets of the Grantham-set. The results thus demonstrate that Williams' numbers either do not exist or are extremely rare. We believe the former; i.e., that No such composite (i.e., a Williams' Number of this type) exists.</div>

<div class='title'>Proof of Goldbach Conjecture</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mohammed_zohal">Mohammed zohal</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In the letter sent by Goldbach to Euler in 1742 (Christian, 1742) he stated that its seems that every odd number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. As reformulated by Euler, an equivalent form of this conjecture called the strong or binary Goldbach conjecture states that all positive even integers greater or equal to 4 can be expressed as the sum of two primes which are sometimes called a Goldbach partition. Jorg (2000) and Matti (1993) have verified it up to 4.1014. Chen (1973) has shown that all large enough even numbers are the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes... The majority of mathematicians believe that Goldbach's conjecture is true, especially on statistical considerations ,on the subject we give the proof of Goldbach's strong conjecture whose veracity is based on a clear and simple approach.</div>

Section 2 shows an approximation which helps at memorizing the square roots of integers up to 10. Section 3 shows the specialities of the squares of integers at the last digits. Section 4 shows how the last two digits are repeated for 2 to the sequential integer powers, and how to find out this. Section 5 contains some mathematical peculiarities at calculating dates.

<div class='title'>On the Distribution of Addition Chains</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/theophilus_agama">Theophilus Agama</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we study the theory of addition chains producing any given number $n\geq 3$. With the goal of estimating the partial sums of an additive chain, we introduce the notion of the determiners and the regulators of an addition chain and prove the following identities\begin{align}\sum \limits_{j=2}^{\delta(n)+1}s_j=2(n-1)+(\delta(n)-1)+\kappa(a_{\delta(n)})-\varrho(r_{\delta(n)+1})+\int \limits_{2}^{\delta(n)-1}\sum \limits_{2\leq j\leq t}\varrho(r_j)dt\nonumber \end{align}where \begin{align}2,s_3=\kappa(a_3)+\varrho(r_3),\ldots,s_{k-1}=\kappa(a_{k-1})+\varrho(r_{k-1}),s_{k}=\kappa(a_{k})+\varrho(r_{k})=n\nonumber \end{align}are the associated generators of the chain $1,2,\ldots,s_{k-1},s_{k}=n$ of length $\delta(n)$. Also we obtain the identity\begin{align}\sum \limits_{j=2}^{\delta(n)+1}\kappa(a_j)=(n-1)+(\delta(n)-1)+\kappa(a_{\delta(n)})-\varrho(r_{\delta(n)+1})+\int \limits_{2}^{\delta(n)-1}\sum \limits_{2\leq j\leq t}\varrho(r_j)dt.\nonumber \end{align}</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/theophilus_agama">Theophilus Agama</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we develop a general method for estimating correlations of the forms \begin{align}\sum \limits_{n\leq x}G(n)G(x-n),\nonumber \end{align}and \begin{align}\sum \limits_{n\leq x}G(n)G(n+l)\nonumber \end{align}for a fixed $1\leq l\leq x$ and where $G:\mathbb{N}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$. To distinguish between the two types of correlations, we call the first \textbf{type} $2$ correlation and the second \textbf{type} $1$ correlation. As an application we estimate the lower bound for the \textbf{type} $2$ correlation of the master function given by \begin{align}\sum \limits_{n\leq x}\Upsilon(n)\Upsilon(n+l_0)\geq (1+o(1))\frac{x}{2\mathcal{C}(l_0)}\log \log ^2x,\nonumber \end{align}provided $\Upsilon(n)\Upsilon(n+l_0)&gt;0$. We also use this method to provide a first proof of the twin prime conjecture by showing that \begin{align}\sum \limits_{n\leq x}\Lambda(n)\Lambda(n+2)\geq (1+o(1))\frac{x}{2\mathcal{C}(2)}\nonumber \end{align}for some $\mathcal{C}:=\mathcal{C}(2)&gt;0$.</div>

<div class='title'>Optimal Binary Number System When Numbers Are Energy?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this short note, we will quickly look at optimal binary number systems used in communication (or transactions) under the assumption that one must use energy to give away (send) numbers. We show that the current binary system is not the optimal binary number system as it can be arbitraged. We also show that there exist other optimal binary number systems in such a scenario. Naturally, one has to ask, ``Optimal for whom? -- For the one sending the number out, or for the one receiving the number?'' Alternatively, we can have a binary number system that, on average, is neutral for both sender and receiver. Numbers are typically only considered to have symbolic value, but if the money units were so small that they came in the smallest possibly energy units, then we could be forced to switch to a number system where the physical value of each number was equal to its symbolic value. That is to say, the physical value of three must be higher than the physical value of two, for example. Numbers are always physical because storing or sending a number from a computer requires bits, and bits of information require energy.</div>

<div class='title'>A Proof of the Twin Prime Conjecture</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/theophilus_agama">Theophilus Agama</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we prove the twin prime conjecture by showing that \begin{align} \sum \limits_{\substack{p\leq x\\p,p+2\in \mathbb{P}}}1\geq (1+o(1))\frac{x}{2\mathcal{C}\log^2 x}\nonumber \end{align}where $\mathcal{C}:=\mathcal{C}(2)&gt;0$ fixed and $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of all prime numbers. In particular it follows that \begin{align} \sum \limits_{p,p+2\in \mathbb{P}}1=\infty\nonumber \end{align}by taking $x\longrightarrow \infty$ on both sides of the inequality. We start by developing a general method for estimating correlations of the form \begin{align} \sum \limits_{n\leq x}G(n)G(n+l)\nonumber \end{align}for a fixed $1\leq l\leq x$ and where $G:\mathbb{N}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The {\it technique} of classical mathematics involves only potential infinity, i.e. infinity is understood only as a limit, and, as a rule, legitimacy of every limit is thoroughly investigated. However, {\it the basis} of classical mathematics does involve actual infinity: the infinite ring of integers $Z$ is the starting point for constructing infinite sets with different cardinalities, and, even in standard textbooks on classical mathematics, it is not even posed a problem whether $Z$ can be treated as a limit of finite sets. On the other hand, finite mathematics starts from the ring $R_p=(0,1,...p-1)$ (where all operations are modulo $p$) and the theory deals only with a finite number of elements. We give a direct proof that $Z$ can be treated as a limit of $R_p$ when $p\to\infty$, and the proof does not involve actual infinity. Then we explain that, as a consequence, finite mathematics is more fundamental than classical one.</div>

<div class='title'>The Requirements on the Non-trivial Roots of the Riemann Zeta via the Dirichlet Eta Sum</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/william_blickos">William Blickos</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>An explanation of the Riemann Hypothesis is given in sections, using the well known Dirichlet Eta sum equivalence, beginning with a brief history of the paper and a statement of the problem. The next 3 sections dissect the complex Eta sum into 8 real valued sums and 2 constants. Parts 6 and 8 explain a recursive relationship between the sums and constants, via 2 systems of 2 equations, while parts 7 and 9 explain the conditions generated from both systems. Finally, section 10 concludes the explanation in terms of the original inputs of the Dirichlet Eta sum, proves Riemann's suspicion, and it shows that the only possible solution for the real portion of the complex input, commonly labeled a, is that it must equal 1/2 and only 1/2.</div>

<div class='title'>If Riemann&#8217;s Zeta Function is True, it Contradicts Zeta&#8217;s Dirichlet Series, Causing &quot;Explosion&quot;. If it is False, it Causes Unsoundness.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ayal_sharon">Ayal Sharon</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Riemann's &quot;analytic continuation&quot; produces a second definition of the Zeta function, that Riemann claimed is convergent throughout half-plane $s \in \mathbb{C}$, $\text{Re}(s)\le1$, (except at $s=1$). This contradicts the original definition of the Zeta function (the Dirichlet series), which is proven divergent there. Moreover, a function cannot be both convergent and divergent at any domain value. In other mathematics conjectures and assumed-proven theorems, and in physics, the Riemann Zeta function (or the class of $L$-functions that generalizes it) is assumed to be true. Here the author shows that the two contradictory definitions of Zeta violate Aristotle's Laws of Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle. The of Non-Contradiction is an axiom of classical and intuitionistic logics, and an inherent axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (which was designed to avoid paradoxes). If Riemann's definition of Zeta is true, then the Zeta function is a contradiction that causes deductive &quot;explosion&quot;, and the foundation logic of mathematics must be replaced with one that is paradox-tolerant. If Riemann's Zeta is false, it renders unsound all theorems and conjectures that falsely assume that it is true. Riemann's Zeta function appears to be false, because its derivation uses the Hankel contour, which violates the preconditions of Cauchy's integral theorem.</div>

<div class='title'>Analytic Continuation of the Zeta Function Violates the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC)</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ayal_sharon">Ayal Sharon</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Dirichlet series of the Zeta function was long ago proven to be divergent throughout half-plane Re(s) =&lt; 1. If also Riemann's proposition is true, that there exists an &quot;expression&quot; of the Zeta function that is convergent at all values of s (except at s = 1), then the Zeta function is both divergent and convergent throughout half-plane Re(s) =&lt; 1 (except at s = 1). This result violates all three of Aristotle's &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;: the Law of Identity (LOI), the Law of the Excluded Middle (LEM), and the Law of Non-Contradition (LNC). In classical and intuitionistic logics, the violation of LNC also triggers the &quot;Principle of Explosion&quot;: Ex Contradictione Quodlibet (ECQ). In addition, the Hankel contour used in Riemann's analytic continuation of the Zeta function violates Cauchy's integral theorem, providing another proof of the invalidity of analytic continuation of the Zeta function. Also, Riemann's Zeta function is one of the L-functions, which are all invalid, because they are generalizations of the invalid analytic continuation of the Zeta function. This result renders unsound all theorems (e.g. Modularity, Fermat's last) and conjectures (e.g. BSD, Tate, Hodge, Yang-Mills) that assume that an L-function (e.g. Riemann's Zeta function) is valid. We also show that the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is not &quot;non-trivially true&quot; in classical logic, intuitionistic logic, or three-valued logics (3VLs) that assign a third truth-value to paradoxes (Bochvar's 3VL, Priest's LP).</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the Riemann zeta function, when the value of the nontrivial zero is zero, the value of the real part of the function is negative from 0 to 0.5, but the value of the real part of the function is 0.5 to 1 I found it to be positive. We also found that the positive and negative of the imaginary part also interchanged with the real part 0.5. This tendency is seen as a tendency near the non-trivial zero value, but becomes less and less as it deviates from the non-trivial zero value. We present and discuss the case of four non-trivial zero values. This seems to be an important finding and will be announced here.</div>

That is to say, that the only solution in the natural numbers of a^x - b^y=1 for a,b,x,y &gt; 1 is a=3, x=2, b=2, y=3. In other words, Catalan conjectured that 3^2-2^3=1 is the only nontrivial solution.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/timothy_w_jones">Timothy W. Jones</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This is an easy approach to proving zeta(2) is irrational. The reasoning is by analogy with gym weights that are rational proportions of a unit. Sometimes the sum of such weights is expressible as a multiple of a single term in the sum and sometimes it isn't. The partials of zeta(2) are of the latter type. We use a result of real analysis and this fact to show the infinite sum has this same property and hence is irrational.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We evaluate the sums $\sum_{j=0}^k{u_{rj+s}^{2n}\,z^j}$, $\sum_{j=0}^k{u_{rj+s}^{2n-1}\,z^j}$ and $\sum_{j=0}^k{v_{rj+s}^{n}\,z^j}$, where $r$, $s$ and $k$ are any integers, $n$ is any nonnegative integer, $z$ is arbitrary and $(u_n)$ and $(v_n)$ are the Lucas sequences of the first kind and of the second kind, respectively. As natural consequences we obtain explicit forms of the generating functions for the powers of the terms of Lucas sequences with indices in arithmetic progression.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/timothy_w_jones">Timothy W. Jones</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We modify Sondow's geometric proof of the irrationality of e. The modification uses sector areas on circles, rather than closed intervals. Using this circular version of Sondow's proof, we see a way to understand the irrationality of a series. We evolve the idea of proving all possible rational value convergence points of a series are excluded because all partials are not expressible as fractions with the denominators of their terms. If such fractions cover the rationals, then the series should be irrational. Both the irrationality of e and that of zeta(n&gt;=2) are proven using these criteria: the terms cover the rationals and the partials escape the terms.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/toshiro_takami">Toshiro Takami</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>I also found a zero point which seems to deviate from 0.5. I thought that the zero point outside 0.5 can not be found very easily in the area which can not be shown in the figure, but this area can not be represented in the figure but can be found one after another. It is completely unknown whether this axis is distorted in the 0.5 axis or just by coincidence. The number of zero points in the area that can not be shown in the figure is now 43. No matter how you looked it was not found in other areas. It seemed that there is no other way to interpret this axis as 0.5 axis is distorted in this area. Somewhere on the net there is a memory that reads the mathematician's view that &quot;there are countless zero points in the vicinity of 0.5 on high area&quot;. We are reporting that the zero point search of the high-value area of the imaginary part which was giving up as it is no longer possible with the supercomputer is no longer possible, is reported. 43 zero-point searches in the high-value area of the imaginary part are thus successful. This means that the zero point search in the high-value area of the imaginary part has succeeded in the 43. We will also write 43 zero point searches of the successful high-value area of the imaginary part. There are many counterexamples far beyond 0.5, which is far beyond the limit, but the computer can not calculate it. Moreover, I believe that it can only be confirmed on supercomputer whether this is really counterexample. In addition, it is necessary to make corrections in the supercomputer.</div>

<div class='title'>Are Imaginary Numbers Rooted in an Asymmetric Number System? The Alternative is a Symmetric Number System!</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/pankaj_mani">Pankaj Mani</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we point out an interesting asymmetry in the rules of fundamental mathematics between positive and negative numbers. Further, we show that there exists an alternative numerical system that is basically identical to today&#8217;s system, but where positive numbers dominate over negative numbers. This is like a mirror symmetry of the existing number system. The asymmetry in both of these systems leads to imaginary and complex numbers. We also suggest an alternative number system with perfectly symmetrical rules &#8211; that is, where there is no dominance of negative numbers over positive numbers, or vice versa, and where imaginary and complex numbers are no longer needed. This number system seems to be superior to other numerical systems, as it brings simplicity and logic back to areas that have been dominated by complex rules for much of the history of mathematics. We also briefly discuss how the Riemann hypothesis may be linked to the asymmetry in the current number system. The foundation rules of a number system can, in general, not be proven incorrect or correct inside the number system itself. However, the ultimate goal of a number system is, in our view, to be able to describe nature accurately. The optimal number system should therefore be developed with feedback from nature. If nature, at a very fundamental level, is ruled by symmetry, then a symmetric number system should make it easier to understand nature than a asymmetric number system would. We hypothesize that a symmetric number system may thus be better suited to describing nature. Such a number system should be able to get rid of imaginary numbers in space-time and quantum mechanics, for example, two areas of physics that to this day are clouded in mystery.</div>

Then, using this equation, it was proven by induction that there is at least one prime number between n^2 and (n + 1)^2 for all positive integers n thus proving Legendre&#8217;s conjecture for sufficiently large values n. The error between the derived equation and the actual number of prime numbers less than n was empirically proven to be very small (0.291% at n = 50,000), and it was proven that the size of the error declines as n increases, thus validating the proof.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A twin prime is defined as a pair of prime numbers (p1,p2) such that p1 + 2 = p2. The Twin Prime Conjecture states that there are an infinite number of twin primes. A more general conjecture by de Polignac states that for every natural number k, there are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2k is also prime. The case where k = 1 is the Twin Prime Conjecture. In this document, a function is derived that corresponds to the number of twin primes less than n for large values of n. Then by proof by induction, it is shown that as n increases indefinitely, the function also increases indefinitely thus proving the Twin Prime Conjecture. Using this same methodology, the de Polignac Conjecture is also shown to be true.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/khalid_ibrahim">Khalid Ibrahim</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, not only did we disprove the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) but we also showed that zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta (s)$ can be found arbitrary close to the line $\Re (s) =1$. Our method to reach this conclusion is based on analyzing the fine behavior of the partial sum of the Dirichlet series with the Mobius function $M (s) = \sum_n \mu (n) /n^s$ defined over $p_r$ rough numbers (i.e. numbers that have only prime factors greater than or equal to $p_r$). Two methods to analyze the partial sum fine behavior are presented and compared. The first one is based on establishing a connection between the Dirichlet series with the Mobius function $M (s) $ and a functional representation of the zeta function $\zeta (s)$ in terms of its partial Euler product. Complex analysis methods (specifically, Fourier and Laplace transforms) were then used to analyze the fine behavior of partial sum of the Dirichlet series. The second method to estimate the fine behavior of partial sum was based on integration methods to add the different co-prime partial sum terms with prime numbers greater than or equal to $p_r$. Comparing the results of these two methods leads to a contradiction when we assume that $\zeta (s)$ has no zeros for $\Re (s) &gt; c$ and $c &lt;1$.</div>

<div class='title'>A New Proof of the Strong Goldbach Conjecture</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/es-said_en-naoui">Es-said En-naoui</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Goldbach conjecture dates back to 1742 ; we refer the reader to [1]-[2] for a history of the conjecture. Christian Goldbach stated that every odd integer greater than seven can be written as the sum of at most three prime numbers. Leonhard Euler then made a stronger conjecture that every even integer greater than four can be written as the sum of two primes. Since then, no one has been able to prove the Strong Goldbach Conjecture.\\ The only best known result so far is that of Chen [3], proving that every sufficiently large even integer N can be written as the sum of a prime number and the product of at most two prime numbers. Additionally, the conjecture has been verified to be true for all even integers up to $4.10^{18}$ in 2014 , J\&quot;erg [4] and Tom\'as [5]. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true for all even integers greater than 8.</div>

To prove FLT, we first show that $\alpha$ can not be $2$; we then show that $\alpha$ can not be $3$, etc. While this is is the standard method of induction, we refer to it here as the ``infinite ascent'' technique, in contrast to Fermat's original ``infinite descent'' technique.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/waldemar_puszkarz">Waldemar Puszkarz</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Computer experiments reveal that twin primes tend to center on nonsquarefree multiples of 6 more often than on squarefree multiples of 6 compared to what should be expected from the ratio of the number of nonsquarefree multiples of 6 to the number of squarefree multiples of 6 equal $\pi^2/3-1$, or ca 2.290. For multiples of 6 surrounded by twin primes, this ratio is 2.427, a relative difference of ca $6.0\%$ measured against the expected value. A deviation from the expected value of this ratio, ca $1.9\%$, exists also for isolated primes. This shows that the distribution of primes is biased towards nonsquarefree numbers, a phenomenon most likely previously unknown. For twins, this leads to nonsquarefree numbers gaining an excess of $1.2\%$ of the total number of twins. In the case of isolated primes, this excess for nonsquarefree numbers amounts to $0.4\%$ of the total number of such primes. The above numbers are for the first $10^{10}$ primes, with the bias showing a tendency to grow, at least for isolated primes.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The Beal Conjecture considers positive integers A, B, and C having respective positive integer exponents X, Y, and Z all greater than 2, where bases A, B, and C must have a common prime factor. Taking the general form A^X + B^Y = C^Z, we explore a small opening in the conjecture through reformulation and substitution to create two new variables. One we call 'C dot' representing and replacing C and the other we call 'Z dot' representing and replacing Z. With this, we show that 'C dot' and 'Z dot' are separate continuous functions, with argument (A^X + B^Y), that achieve all positive integers during their continuous non-constant rates of infinite ascent. Possibilities for each base and exponent in the reformulated general equation A^X +B^Y = ('C dot')^('Z dot') are examined using a binary table along with analyzing user input restrictions and 'C dot' values relative to A and B. Lastly, an indirect proof is made, where conclusively we find the continuity theorem to hold over the conjecture.</div>

<div class='title'>Riemann's Analytic Continuation of Zeta(s) Contradicts the Law of the Excluded Middle, and is Derived by Using Cauchy's Integral Theorem While Contradicting the Theorem's Prerequisites</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ayal_sharon">Ayal Sharon</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Law of the Excluded Middle holds that either a statement &quot;X&quot; or its opposite &quot;not X&quot; is true. In Boolean algebra form, Y = X XOR (not X). Riemann's analytic continuation of Zeta(s) contradicts the Law of the Excluded Middle, because the Dirichlet series Zeta(s) is proven divergent in the half-plane Re(s)&lt;=1. Further inspection of the derivation of Riemann's analytic continuation of $\zeta(s)$ shows that it is wrongly based on the Cauchy integral theorem, and thus false.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/juan_moreno_borrallo">Juan Moreno Borrallo</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper it is proposed and proved a conjecture of existence of a prime number on the arithmetic progression S_{a,b}=\left\{ ab+1,ab+2,ab+3,...,ab+(b-1)\right\} As corollaries of this proof, they are proved many classical prime number&#8217;s conjectures and theorems, but mainly Bertrand's theorem, and Oppermann's, Legendre&#8217;s, Brocard&#8217;s, and Andrica&#8217;s conjectures.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/timothy_w_jones">Timothy W. Jones</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We prove that partial sums of $\zeta(n)-1=z_n$ are not given by any single decimal in a number base given by a denominator of their terms. This result, applied to all partials, shows that partials are excluded from an ever greater number of rational, possible convergence points. The limit of the partials is $z_n$ and the limit of the exclusions leaves only irrational numbers. Thus $z_n$ is proven to be irrational. Alternative proofs of this same type are given.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In psychology, the Chameleon Effect describes how an animal's behaviour can adapt to, or mimic, its environment through non-conscious mimicry. In the first part of this paper, we show how $a^x - b^y$ can be expressed as a binomial expansion (with an upper index, $z$) that, like a chameleon, mimics a standard binomial formula (to the power $z$) without its own value changing even when $z$ itself changes. In the second part we will show how this leads to a proof for the Beal Conjecture. We finish by outlining how this method can be applied to a more generalised form of the equation.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/timothy_w_jones">Timothy W. Jones</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Ivan Niven's proof of the irrationality of pi is often cited because it is brief and uses only calculus. However it is not well motivated. Using the concept that a quadratic function with the same symmetric properties as sine should when multiplied by sine and integrated obey upper and lower bounds for the integral, a contradiction is generated for rational candidate values of pi. This simplifying concept yields a more motivated proof of the irrationality of pi and pi squared.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A number system is developed to visualize the terms and partials of zeta(n&gt;1). This number system consists of radii that generate sectors. The sectors have areas corresponing to all rational numbers and can be added via a tail to head vector addition. Dots on the circles give an un-ambiguous cross reference to decimal systems in all bases. We show, in the proof section of this paper, first that all partials require decimal bases greater than the last denominator used in the partial, then that this can be used to make a sequence of nested intervals with rational endpoints. Using Cantor's Nested Interval theorem this gives the convergence point of zeta series and disallows rational values, thus proving the irrationality of zeta(n&gt;1).</div>

<div class='abstract'>An attempt of using elementary approach to prove Fermat's last theorem (FLT) is given. For infinitely many prime numbers, Case I of the FLT can be proved using this approach. Furthermore, if a conjecture proposed in this paper is true (k-3 conjecture), then case I of the FLT is proved for all prime numbers. For case II of the FLT, a constraint for possible solutions is obtained.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Riemann Hypothesis, Complex Scalings and Logarithmic Time Reversal</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>An approach to solving the Riemann Hypothesis is revisited within the framework of the special properties of $\Theta$ (theta) functions, and the notion of $ {\cal C } { \cal T} $ invariance. The conjugation operation $ {\cal C }$ amounts to complex scaling transformations, and the $ {\cal T } $ operation $ t \rightarrow ( 1/ t ) $ amounts to the reversal $ log (t) \rightarrow - log ( t ) $. A judicious scaling-like operator is constructed whose spectrum $E_s = s ( 1 - s ) $ is real-valued, leading to $ s = {1\over 2} + i \rho$, and/or $ s $ = real. These values are the location of the non-trivial and trivial zeta zeros, respectively. A thorough analysis of the one-to-one correspondence among the zeta zeros, and the orthogonality conditions among pairs of eigenfunctions, reveals that $no$ zeros exist off the critical line. The role of the $ {\cal C }, {\cal T } $ transformations, and the properties of the Mellin transform of $ \Theta$ functions were essential in our construction.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Using an extension of the idea of the radical of a number, as well as a few other ideas, it is indicated as to why one might expect the Oesterle-Masser conjecture to be true. Based on structural elements arising from this proof, a criterion is then developed and shown to be potentially sufficient to resolve two relatively deep conjectures about the structure of the prime numbers. A sketch is consequently provided as to how it might be possible to demonstrate this criterion, borrowing ideas from information theory and cybernetics.</div>

The advantage of our formulas in spite of the dificulty associated with extracting sin(x) lies in their degree of convergence, which is infinite, they prove the Borweins brothers hypothesis on the construction of algorithms At any speed as symbolized in our generic formula (8) of this paper.

<div class='title'>An Introduction to the N-Irreducible Sequents and the N-Irreducible Number</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alexis_zaganidis">Alexis Zaganidis</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this work, we introduce the $n$-irreducible sequents and the $n$-irreducible numbers defined with the help of the second order logic. We give many concrete examples of $n$-irreducible numbers and $n$-irreducible sequents with the Peano's axioms and the axioms of the real numbers. Shortly, a sequent is $n$-irreducible iff the sequent is composed by some closed hypotheses and a $n$-irreducible formula (a close formula with one internal variable such that the formula is only true when we set that variable to the unique natural number $n$), and it does not exist some strict sub-sequent which are composed by some closed sub-hypotheses and some sub-$m$-irreducible formula with $m&gt;1$. The definition is motivated by the intuition that \Nathypo do not carry natural numbers or &quot;hidden natural numbers&quot; except for the numbers $0$ and $1$, i.e., they can be used in a $n$-irreducible sequent. Moreover, we postulate at second order of logic that \Nathypo are not chosen randomly: \Nathypo has the propriety to give the largest $n$-irreducible number $N_Z \NZ$ among a finite number of $n$-irreducible sequents. The Collatz conjecture, the Goldbach's conjecture, the Polignac's conjecture, the Firoozbakht's conjecture, the Oppermann's conjecture, the Agoh-Giuga conjecture, the generalized Fermat's conjecture and the Schinzel's hypothesis H are reviewed with this new (second order logic) $n$-irreducible axiom. Finally, two open questions remain: Can we prove that a natural number is not $n$-irreducible? If a $n$-irreducible number $n$ is found with a function symbol $f$ where its outputs values are only $0$ and $1$, can we always replace the function symbol $f$ by a another function symbol $\tilde{f}$ such that $\tilde{f}=1-f$ and the new sequent is still $n$-irreducible?</div>

<div class='abstract'>In our previous work (The distribution of prime numbers: overview of n.ln(n), (1) and (2)) we defined a new method derived from Rosser's theorem (2) and we used it in order to approximate the nth prime number. In this paper we improve our method to try to determine the next prime number if the previous is known. We use our method with five intervals and two values for n (see Methods and results). Our preliminary results show a reduced difference between the real next prime number and the number given by our algorithm. However long-term studies are required to better estimate the next prime number and to reduce the difference when n tends to infinity. Indeed an efficient algorithm is an algorithm that could be used in practical research to find new prime numbers for instance.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/redoane_daoudi">R&#233;doane Daoudi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The empirical formula giving the nth prime number p(n) is p(n) = n.ln(n) (from ROSSER (2)). Other studies have been performed (from DUSART for example (1)) in order to better estimate the nth prime number. Unfortunately these formulas don't work since there is a significant difference between the real nth prime number and the number given by the formulas. Here we propose a new model in which the difference is effectively reduced compared to the empirical formula. We discuss about the results and hypothesize that p(n) can be approximated with a constant defined in this work. As prime numbers are important to cryptography and other fields, a better knowledge of the distribution of prime numbers would be very useful. Further investigations are needed to understand the behavior of this constant and therefore to determine the nth prime number with a basic formula that could be used in both theoretical and practical research.</div>

The key idea of this new approach is that there exists a general method to solve this problem by using only arithmetic progressions and congruences. As consequences of Bunyakovsky's proven conjecture, three Landau's problems are resolved: the n^2+1 problem, the twin primes conjecture and the binary Goldbach conjecture. The method is also used to prove that there are infinitely many primorial and factorial primes.</div>

According to the induction, a new representation (for dynamics) called ``code'' is introduced, to represent the occurred $3*x+1$ and $x/2$ computations during the process from starting number to the first transformed number that is less than the starting number. In a code $3*x+1$ is represented by 1 and $x/2$ is represented by 0. We find that code is a building block of the original dynamics from starting number to 1, and thus is more primitive for modeling quantitative properties. Some properties only exist in dynamics represented by code, but not in original dynamics. We discover and prove some inherent laws of code formally. Code as a whole is prefix-free, and has a unified form. Every code can be divided into code segments and each segment has a form $\{10\}^{p \geq 0}0^{q \geq 1}$. Besides, $p$ can be computed by judging whether $x \in[0]_2$, $x\in[1]_4$, or computed by $t=(x-3)/4$, without any concrete computation of $3*x+1$ or $x/2$. Especially, starting numbers in certain residue class have the same code, and their code has a short length. That is, $CODE(x \in [1]_4)=100,$ $CODE((x-3)/4 \in [0]_4)=101000,$ $CODE((x-3)/4 \in [2]_8)=10100100,$ $CODE((x-3)/4 \in [5]_8)=10101000,$ $CODE((x-3)/4 \in [1]_{32})=10101001000,$ $CODE((x-3)/4\in [3]_{32})=10101010000,$ $CODE((x-3)/4\in [14]_{32})=10100101000.$ The experiment results again confirm above discoveries. We also give a conjecture on $x \in [3]_4$ and an approach to the proof of Collatz conjecture. Those discoveries support the proposed induction and are helpful to the final proof of Collatz conjecture.</div>

Writing $D(n)=e^\gamma n \log \log n-\sigma(n),$ and $d(n)=\frac{D(n)}{n},$ we prove unconditionally that $\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} d(n)=0.$ The main ingredients of the proof are an estimate for Chebyshev summatory function, and an effective version of Mertens third theorem due to Rosser and Schoenfeld.

<div class='abstract'>In this book a multitude of Diophantine equations and their partial or complete solutions are presented. How should we solve, for example, the equation &#951;(&#960;(x)) = &#960;(&#951;(x)), where &#951; is the Smarandache function and &#960; is Riemann function of counting the number of primes up to x, in the set of natural numbers? If an analytical method is not available, an idea would be to recall the empirical search for solutions. We establish a domain of searching for the solutions and then we check all possible situations, and of course we retain among them only those solutions that verify our equation. In other words, we say that the equation does not have solutions in the search domain, or the equation has n solutions in this domain. This mode of solving is called partial resolution. Partially solving a Diophantine equation may be a good start for a complete solving of the problem. The authors have identified 62 Diophantine equations that impose such approach and they partially solved them. For an efficient resolution it was necessarily that they have constructed many useful &#8221;tools&#8221; for partially solving the Diophantine equations into a reasonable time. The computer programs as tools were written in Mathcad, because this is a good mathematical software where many mathematical functions are implemented. Transposing the programs into another computer language is facile, and such algorithms can be turned to account on other calculation systems with various processors.</div>

<div class='title'>Two Statements that Are Equivalent to a Conjecture Related to the Distribution of Prime Numbers</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/german_paz">Germ&#225;n Paz</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Let $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. In [8] we ask the question whether any sequence of $n$ consecutive integers greater than $n^2$ and smaller than $(n+1)^2$ contains at least one prime number, and we show that this is actually the case for every $n\leq 1,193,806,023$. In addition, we prove that a positive answer to the previous question for all $n$ would imply Legendre's, Brocard's, Andrica's, and Oppermann's conjectures, as well as the assumption that for every $n$ there is always a prime number in the interval $[n,n+2\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor-1]$. &lt;p&gt;Let $\pi[n+g(n),n+f(n)+g(n)]$ denote the amount of prime numbers in the interval $[n+g(n),n+f(n)+g(n)]$. Here we show that the conjecture described in [8] is equivalent to the statement that &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;$$\pi[n+g(n),n+f(n)+g(n)]\ge 1\text{, }\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\text{,}$$ &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;where &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;$$f(n)=\left(\frac{n-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor^2-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor-\beta}{|n-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor^2-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor-\beta|}\right)(1-\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor)\text{, }g(n)=\left\lfloor1-\sqrt{n}+\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\right\rfloor\text{,}$$ &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;and $\beta$ is any real number such that $1&lt;\beta&lt;2$. We also prove that the conjecture in question is equivalent to the statement that &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;$$\pi[S_n,S_n+\lfloor\sqrt{S_n}\rfloor-1]\ge 1\text{, }\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\text{,}$$ &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;where &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;$$S_n=n+\frac{1}{2}\left\lfloor\frac{\sqrt{8n+1}-1}{2}\right\rfloor^2-\frac{1}{2}\left\lfloor\frac{\sqrt{8n+1}-1}{2}\right\rfloor+1\text{.}$$ &lt;br&gt;% &lt;br&gt;We use this last result in order to create plots of $h(n)=\pi[S_n,S_n+\lfloor\sqrt{S_n}\rfloor-1]$ for many values of $n$.</div>

For this purpose, the Dirichlet series $M (s) $ has been modified and represented in terms of the partial Euler product by progressively eliminating the numbers that first have a prime factor 2, then 3, then 5, ..up to the prime number $p_r $ to obtain the series $M(s,p_r)$. It is shown that the series $M(s)$ and the new series $M(s,p_r)$ have the same region of convergence for every $p_r$. Unlike the partial sum of $M(s)$ that has irregular behavior, the partial sum of the new series exhibits regular behavior as $p_r$ approaches infinity.

Separately AVNPP for prime and AVNPC for composite positive integers. We also deduced formulas for computation of deviation NPTN from AVNPP and AVNPC. It was shown that if $n$ go to infinity then NPTN go to AVNPC or AVNPP respectively that permit to apply formulas for AVNPP and AVNPC to computation of NPTN.

<div class='title'>Summability Calculus</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ibrahim_m_alabdulmohsin">Ibrahim M. Alabdulmohsin</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this manuscript, we present the foundations of Summability Calculus, which places various established results in number theory, infinitesimal calculus, summability theory, asymptotic analysis, information theory, and the calculus of finite differences under a single simple umbrella. Using Summability Calculus, any given finite sum bounded by a variable n becomes immediately in analytic form. Not only can we differentiate and integrate with respect to the bound n without having to rely on an explicit analytic formula for the finite sum, but we can also deduce asymptotic expansions, accelerate convergence, assign natural values to divergent sums, and evaluate the finite sum for any complex value of n. This follows because the discrete definition of the simple finite sum embodies a unique natural continuation to the entire complex plane. Throughout the paper, many established results are strengthened such as the Bohr-Mollerup theorem, Stirling's approximation, Glaisher's approximation, and the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. In addition, many celebrated theorems are extended and generalized such as the Euler- Maclaurin summation formula and Boole's summation formula. Finally, we show that countless identities that have been proved throughout the past 300 years by different mathematicians using different approaches can actually be derived in an elementary straightforward manner using the rules of Summability Calculus.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alexander_fedorov">Alexander Fedorov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>One of causes why Goldbach's binary problem was unsolved over a long period is that binary representations of even integer 2n (BR2n) in the view of a sum of two odd primes(VSTOP) are considered separately from other BR2n. By purpose of this work is research of connections between different types of BR2n. For realization of this purpose by author was developed the &quot;Arithmetic of binary representations of even positive integer 2n&quot; (ABR2n). In ABR2n are defined four types BR2n. As shown in ABR2n all types BR2n are connected with each other by relations which represent distribution of prime and composite positive integers less than 2n between them.

At the end is produced the proof of the Goldbach's binary problem with help of ABR2n. For it apply method of a proof by contradiction in which we make an assumption that for any 2n not exist BR2n in the VSTOP then make computations at this conditions then we come to contradiction. Hence our assumption is false and forall $2n &gt; 2$ exist BR2n in the VSTOP.</div>

<div class='title'>Multiplication Modulo n Along The Primorials With Its Differences And Variations Applied To The Study Of The Distributions Of Prime Number Gaps. A.K.A. Introduction To The S Model</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/russell_letkeman">Russell Letkeman</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The sequence of sets of Z_n on multiplication where n is a primorial gives us a surprisingly simple and elegant tool to investigate many properties of the prime numbers and their distributions through analysis of their gaps. A natural reason to study multiplication on these boundaries is a construction exists which evolves these sets from one primorial boundary to the next, via the sieve of Eratosthenes, giving us Just In Time prime sieving. To this we add a parallel study of gap sets of various lengths and their evolution all of which together informs what we call the S model. We show by construction there exists for each prime number P a local finite probability distribution and it is surprisingly well behaved. That is we show the vacuum; ie the gaps, has deep structure. We use this framework to prove conjectured distributional properties of the prime numbers by Legendre, Hardy and Littlewood and others. We also demonstrate a novel proof of the Green-Tao theorem. Furthermore we prove the Riemann hypothesis and show the results are perhaps surprising. We go on to use the S model to predict novel structure within the prime gaps which leads to a new Chebyshev type bias we honorifically name the Chebyshev gap bias. We also probe deeper behavior of the distribution of prime numbers via ultra long scale oscillations about the scale of numbers known as Skewes numbers.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/stephen_crowley">Stephen Crowley</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Riemann zeta function can be written as the Mellin transform of the unit interval map w(x)=&#8970;x&#8722;1&#8971;(x&#8970;x&#8722;1&#8971;+x&#8722;1) multiplied by s((s+1)/(s-1)). A finite-sum approximation to &#950;(s) denoted by &#950;w(N;s) which has real roots at s=&#8722;1 and s=0 is examined and an associated function &#967;(N;s) is found which solves the reflection formula &#950;w(N;1&#8722;s)=&#967;(N;s)&#950;w(N;s). A closed-form expression for the integral of &#950;w(N;s) over the interval s=-1..0 is given. The function &#967;(N;s) is singular at s=0 and the residue at this point changes sign from negative to positive between the values of N = 176 and N = 177. Some rather elegant graphs of &#950;w(N;s) and the reflection functions &#967;(N;s) are also provided.

<div class='title'>The Goldbach Conjecture</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ricardo_g_barca">Ricardo G. Barca</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The binary Goldbach conjecture asserts that every even integer greater than 4 is the sum of two primes. In order to prove this statement, we start by defining a kind of double sieve of Eratosthenes as follows. Given an even integer x, we sift out from [1, x] all those elements that are congruents to 0 modulo p, or congruents to x modulo p, where p is a prime less than the square root of x. So, any integer in the interval [sqrt{x}, x] that remains unsifted is a prime p for which either x-p = 1 or x-p is also a prime. Then, we introduce a new way to formulate this sieve, which we call the sequence of k-tuples of remainders. Using this tool, we obtain a lower bound for the number of elements in [1, x] that survives the sifting process. We prove, for every even number x greater than the square of 149, that there exist at least 3 integers in the interval [ 1, x ] that remains unsifted. This proves the binary Goldbach conjecture for every even number x greater than the square of 149, which is our main result.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Transcendence of a number implies the irrationality of powers of a number, but in the case of &pi; there are no separate proofs that powers of &pi; are irrational. We investigate this curiosity. Transcendence proofs for e involve what we call Hermite&#65533;s technique; for &pi;&#65533;s transcendence Lindemann&#65533;s adaptation of Hermite&#65533;s technique is used. Hermite&#65533;s technique is presented and its usage is demonstrated with irrationality proofs of e and powers of e. Applying Lindemann&#65533;s adaptation to a complex polynomial, &pi; is shown to be irrational. This use of a complex polynomial generalizes and powers of &pi; are shown to be irrational. The complex polynomials used involve roots of i and yield regular polygons in the complex plane. One can use graphs of these polygons to visualize various mechanisms used to proof &pi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &pi;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and &pi;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; are irrational.

<div class='abstract'>As it is well known, the Riemann hypothesis on the zeros of the &zeta;(s) function has been assumed to be true in various basic developments of the 20-th century mathematics, although it has never been proved to be correct. The need for a resolution of this open historical problem has been voiced by several distinguished mathematicians. By using preceding works, in this paper we present comprehensive disproofs of the Riemann hypothesis. Moreover, in 1994 the author discovered the arithmetic function J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(&omega;) that can replace Riemann's &zeta;(s) function in view of its proved features: if J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(&omega;) &ne; 0, then the function has infinitely many prime solutions; and if J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(&omega;) = 0, then the function has finitely many prime solutions. By using the Jiang J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&omega;) function we prove the twin prime theorem, Goldbach's theorem and the prime theorem of the form x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1. Due to the importance of resolving the historical open nature of the Riemann hypothesis, comments by interested colleagues are here solicited.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In my works (see the bibliography at the end of the Preface) I often expressed the view that the protracted lack of resolution of fundamental problems in science signals the needs of basically new mathematics. This is the case, for example, for: quantitative representations of biological structures; resolution of the vexing problem of grand-unification; invariant treatment of irreversibility at the classical and operator levels; identification of hadronic constituents definable in our spacetime; achievement of a classical representation of antimatter; and other basic open problems.</div>

<div class='title'>A Derivation of &pi;(n) Based on a Stability Analysis of the Riemann-Zeta Function</div>

<div class='abstract'>The prime-number counting function &pi;(n), which is significant in the prime number theorem, is derived by analyzing the region of convergence of the real-part of the Riemann-Zeta function using the unilateral z-transform. In order to satisfy the stability criteria of the z-transform, it is found that the real part of the Riemann-Zeta function must converge to the prime-counting function.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences incorrectly states a lengthy formula for the sum of the sixth powers of the first n Fibonacci numbers. In this paper we prove a more succinct formulation. We also provide an analogue for the Lucas numbers. Finally, we prove a divisibility result for the sum of certain even powers of the first n Fibonacci numbers.</div>

<div class='title'>On Strategies Towards the Riemann Hypothesis :Fractal Supersymmetric QM and a Trace Formula</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Riemann's hypothesis (RH) states that the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are of the form s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 + i&lambda;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. An improvement of our previous construction to prove the RH is presented by implementing the Hilbert-Polya proposal and furnishing the Fractal Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanical (SUSY-QM) model whose spectrum reproduces the imaginary parts of the zeta zeros. We model the fractal fluctuations of the smooth Wu-Sprung potential ( that capture the average level density of zeros ) by recurring to P a weighted superposition of Weierstrass functions &Sigma;W(x,p,D) and where the summation has to be performed over all primes p in order to recapture the connection between the distribution of zeta zeros and prime numbers. We proceed next with the construction of a smooth version of the fractal QM wave equation by writing an ordinary Schroedinger equation whose fluctuating potential (relative to the smooth Wu-Sprung potential) has the same functional form as the fluctuating part of the level density of zeros. The second approach to prove the RH relies on the existence of a continuous family of scaling-like operators involving the Gauss-Jacobi theta series. An explicit completion relation ( &quot;trace formula&quot;) related to a superposition of eigenfunctions of these scaling-like operators is defined. If the completion relation is satisfied this could be another test of the Riemann Hypothesis. In an appendix we briefly describe our recent findings showing why the Riemann Hypothesis is a consequence of CT -invariant Quantum Mechanics, because &lt; &Psi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; | CT | &Psi;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; &ne; 0 where s are the complex eigenvalues of the scaling-like operators.</div>

<div class='title'>The Riemann Hypothesis is a Consequence of CT-Invariant Quantum Mechanics</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Riemann's hypothesis (RH) states that the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are of the form s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 + i&lambda;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. By constructing a continuous family of scaling-like operators involving the Gauss-Jacobi theta series and by invoking a novel CT-invariant Quantum Mechanics, involving a judicious charge conjugation C and time reversal T operation, we show why the Riemann Hypothesis is true. An infinite family of theta series and their Mellin transform leads to the same conclusions.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Riemann Hypothesis, Area Quantization, Dirac Operators, Modularity and Renormalization Group</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Two methods to prove the Riemann Hypothesis are presented. One is based on the modular properties of &Theta; (theta) functions and the other on the Hilbert-Polya proposal to find an operator whose spectrum reproduces the ordinates &rho;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (imaginary parts) of the zeta zeros in the critical line : s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 + i&rho;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; A detailed analysis of a one-dimensional Dirac-like operator with a potential V(x) is given that reproduces the spectrum of energy levels E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = &rho;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, when the boundary conditions &Psi;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; (x = -&infin;) = &plusmn; &Psi;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; (x = +&infin;) are imposed. Such potential V(x) is derived implicitly from the relation x = x(V) = &pi;/2(dN(V)/dV), where the functional form of N(V) is given by the full-fledged Riemann-von Mangoldt counting function of the zeta zeros, including the &lt;i&gt;fluctuating&lt;/i&gt; as well as the O(E&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt;) terms. The construction is also extended to self-adjoint Schroedinger operators. Crucial is the introduction of an energy-dependent cut-off function &Lambda;(E). Finally, the natural quantization of the phase space areas (associated to &lt;i&gt;nonperiodic&lt;/i&gt; crystal-like structures) in &lt;i&gt;integer&lt;/i&gt; multiples of &pi; follows from the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions of Quantum Mechanics. It allows to find a physical reasoning why the average density of the primes distribution for very large x (O(1/logx)) has a one-to-one correspondence with the asymptotic limit of the &lt;i&gt;inverse&lt;/i&gt; average density of the zeta zeros in the critical line suggesting intriguing connections to the Renormalization Group program.</div>
