<div class='title'>A Novel Identity in Binomial Probability Theory</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ashkan_karimi">Ashkan Karimi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper presents a proof and analysis of a previously unexplored binomial probability identity. We demonstrate that for any positive integer n and probability PA &#8712;(0, 1), the following identity holds:[sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} P_{A}^{n - k} (1 - P_{A})^{k}frac{k - n(1 - P_{A})}{P_{A}} = 0]I provide a rigorous proof of this identity, explore its probabilistic interpretation, and discuss potential applications in statistical analysis, information theory, and computational probability. This result offers new insights into the properties of binomial distributions and contributes to the broader understanding of discrete probability structures.</div>

<div class='title'>Resolving The Cosmological Constant: A Conjecture for Homogeneous Infinitesimals</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/j_p_baugher">J. P. Baugher</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The discovery in 1998 that the universe is paradoxically accelerating its expansion has led some cosmologists to question the correctness of the non-Euclidean geometric theory of gravity, General Relativity. Physically assigning the term Dark Energy to the Cosmological Constant, sometimes viewed as a constant of integration, as the source of this acceleration has only produced even more questions. In the 17th century, there was also a great paradox between two views for the geometric constituents of a line, heterogeneous (made of points) versus homogeneous (made of infinitesimal segments). Evangelista Torricelli elucidated his logical reasoning on why lines must be made of infinitesimal segments instead of points and created one particular fundamental example among many. In this paper, I produce unknown corollaries to Torricelli's argument allowing me to falsify the relationship between his infinitesimals and the Archimedean axiom, resolve L'Hopital's paradox, as well as redefine the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, scale factor/metrics, n-spheres and Gaussian curvature. I conjecture that the intractability of Dark Energy is due to the points of coordinate systems within General Relativity actually being a logically flawed heterogeneous interpretation. I propose that Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and the physics equations based upon them, should be rewritten from the perspective of homogeneous infinitesimals. I introduce the geometrical logic in this paper in order to pave the way for the physical logic.</div>

<div class='title'>A Dynamical Systems Model for Population and Depleting Resources</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/samuel_forbes">Samuel Forbes</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We investigate a coupled, non-linear dynamical systems model for the relationship between population and depleting resources inspired by limits to growth. The model is determined by logistic growth in population with carrying capacity determined by resources. The rate of decline of resources is determined linearly by the population. The model produces an initial exponential increase in population followed by a decrease to the fixed point while congruently resources decrease in a sigmoidal fashion to the fixed point. We fit the model to world population over the period 10000 BC to 2021 in different time intervals corresponding to different growth rates. We show a number of projections to 2500 based on fitting to the time period of 1950 to 2021 with various parameter constraints.</div>

<div class='title'>Computational Complexity Analysis using Negation Negation Normal Form Circuit</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/koji_kobayashi">Koji KOBAYASHI</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>&#27010;&#35201;. This paper describes about analyzing method for computational complexity using Negation Normal Form Circuit. Although Negation Normal Form Circuit can emulate Turing machines, most of the circuits are monotonic. In this paper, Negation Normal Form Circuit is further divided into a monotonic subcircuit consisting of AND and OR gate (Rating Circuit) and a subcircuit consisting of NOT elements, and the analysis focuses on the Rating Circuit. From the viewpoint of the Rating Circuit, the NOT gate is constraint on the input of the Rating Circuit. We can use another input constraints. By changing the constraints of the inputs of Rating Circuit, We can analyse complexity detail. In this paper, we use this method to analyze the complexity of the clique problem.</div>

<div class='title'>Cournot's Principle Revisited</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/bruno_galvan">Bruno Galvan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Cournot's principle states that a typical event (i.e., an event with probability very close to 1) occurs nearly certainly in a single trial of an experiment. This principle has been considered by various authors as the only connection between mathematical probability and the real world of experiments. To make the logical structure of the principle clearer, in this paper a reformulation of the principle is proposed. This reformulation is based on the following three elements: (1) The explicit definition of the empirical property of practical certainty, (2) the clear separation between probability measure and experiment, including the remark that typicality is a mathematical property defined by the probability measure while practical certainty is an empirical property defined by the experiment, and (3) the explicit formulation of the product rule for independent trials. The novel formulation then states that a probability measure P "governs" an experiment E if the events that are typical according to P^n are practically certain according to E^n for all n &gt;= 1, where P^n is the n-fold product of P and E^n is the experiment whose trials are composed of n trials of E. The novel formulation highlights the possible existence of two ambiguities in the principle, namely: (i) that different probability measures govern the same experiment and (ii) that the same probability measure governs different experiments. In this paper the first ambiguity is rigorously disproved, while the second is disproved provided that a suitable property characterizing the empirical equivalence of experiments is assumed.</div>

<div class='title'>The Philosophical Nature of Zero, Negative, and Imaginary Numbers and the Use of Polar Coordinates in Complex Number Calculations</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/bryce_petofi_towne">Bryce Petofi Towne</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Mathematics serves as an abstract tool to study the natural world and its laws, aiding in our understanding and description of natural phenomena. In mathematics, real numbers, imaginary numbers, zero, and negative numbers are fundamental concepts, each with its unique importance and application. However, the philosophical nature of these concepts warrants further exploration. This paper aims to discuss the philosophical essence of imaginary numbers, zero, and negative numbers, argue that imaginary numbers have real-world counterparts, and explore the rationale and advantages of representing imaginary and complex numbers using polar coordinates. Furthermore, we extend our findings to more advanced mathematical problems in complex analysis, differential equations, and number theory, demonstrating the broader impact of our work.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_kenneth_kauffmann">Steven Kenneth Kauffmann</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The tangent function's Taylor expansion about zero is a series of odd powers with positive coefficients; it converges when the absolute value of its argument is less than half pi, and diverges to positive infinity when its argument equals half pi, so with the aid of the ratio test it is seen that twice the square root of the ratio of its successive coefficients is a sequence which converges to pi. The odd derivatives of the tangent function are polynomials in powers of its square with positive integer coefficients, so a recursion of positive integers can be found from which the coefficients of the series described above may be successively obtained. Its related sequence which converges to pi does so monotonically from above, and appears to refine its approximation to pi by about one significant decimal figure per successive term.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper introduces an innovative approach to comprehending and modeling the collective behaviors of students within the context of mathematics education. The core objective is to present a comprehensive mathematicalframework capable of addressing the entire spectrum of behaviors exhibited in mathematics classrooms. We introduce a novel SIR-basedmodel, tailored to capture behaviors under the influence of individual students. Additionally, we propose that interactions among students acrossdifferent classrooms can serve as a regulatory mechanism for these behaviors. To validate our approach, we conduct a series of simulations thatdemonstrate the practicality and significance of our model. This paper significantly contributes to the advancement of our understanding of studentbehaviors in the realm of mathematics education and their mathematical representation. By bridging the gap between mathematical modeling andthe intricate dynamics of student conduct, this work provides valuable insights into the behaviors displayed in math classrooms.</div>

<div class='title'>Pricing of European Options using GBM and Heston Models in C++</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/farid_soroush">Farid Soroush</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The valuation of financial derivatives, particularly options, has long been a topic of interest in finance. Among the various methods developed for option pricing, the Monte Carlo simulation stands out due to its versatility and capability to model complex financial instruments. In this article, we apply the Monte Carlo method to price European options using two prominent models: the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and the Heston model. While the GBM model assumes constant volatility and offers simplicity, it often falls short in capturing real market dynamics. Conversely, the Heston model introduces stochastic volatility, providing a more nuanced representation of market behaviors. Leveraging the computational efficiency of C++, our simulations reveal distinct price paths for each model. The GBM paths exhibit smooth trajectories, while the Heston paths are more varied, reflecting its allowance for stochastic volatility. Statistical analyses further underscore a significant difference in the final stock prices generated by the two models. The Heston model's prices display a broader distribution, capturing the model's inherent variability. Additionally, autocorrelation analyses suggest a more intricate autoregressive structure for the Heston model. In conclusion, while the GBM model provides simplicity and predictability, the Heston model offers a richer, albeit more complex, representation, especially in volatile market scenarios. This article offers a comparative study of the GBM and Heston models, shedding light on their utility under varying market conditions.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/farid_soroush">Farid Soroush</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Predicting key macroeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a critical task in quantitative finance and economics. Precise forecasts of GDP can help in policy-making, investment decisions, and understanding the overall economic health of a country. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering sophisticated techniques for modeling complex systems and making predictions. This project presents a comparative analysis of three machine learning models &#8212; Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression &#8212; for predicting GDP. Our aim is to assess their performance and identify the model that provides the most accurate forecasts.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Laments from teachers of all stripes are growing. Looking out from behind the podium one can constantly see a sea of bored, confused, seemingly moribund students staring at their I-phones, maybe still wearing Covid masks. Between the pandemic and social media and traditional sage on a stage teaching teachers reside: a kind of prehistoric fish out of any known water. In this article we propose a solution using in novel and controversial ways TI-84 CE calculators. The idea is to show how to animate students via increased teacher-student and student-student interactions. It is field tested: life does come back into the classroom with the techniques I give in this article: get an easy A using your cool calculator, filling in a shell provided by the teacher.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/timothy_w_jones">Timothy W. Jones</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Simple craps, a Vegas casino game, is easily modeled using a TI-83's programming, list, and statistics features. Roll two dice. If the coming out roll, as it is called is 2, 3, or 12, the player immediately loses. If a 7 or 11 is rolled, they immediately win. If any of the remaining totals are rolled, if the player rolls that number before rolling a 7, they win, not they lose. A program can be initialized with a bank roll and a standard, non-changing bet. Using the list feature 999 rolls, the maximum size of a list, can be stored in a built-in list. A bar chart for the distribution of numbers is easily generated and confirms the calculated probabilities. The code to mimic the game is straight-forward. The user repeatedly plays the game until the stake is 0, an inevitability given say a stake of $100 and a bet of $5. This certainty instills the truth: it's a loser's game.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The paper is comprised of two parts.

This similarity is help for further determination either that the similarity is only accidental, or that we can derive the Ramanujan formula in this way. This is also help for setting up a calculation system where we would estimate the probabilities with which we can obtain guessed formulae for $pi$ that are very accurate and very simple. (We only consider formulae that are not the approximations of the exact formulae for $pi$.) In the second part, it discusses various guessed formulae for the fine structure constant and for the other physical constants, and how the above probability calculation would help estimate whether these formulae have a physical basis or are only accidental.</div>

<div class='title'>The Intuitive Root of Classical Logic, an Associated Decision Problem and the Middle Way</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/abhishek_majhi">Abhishek Majhi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We revisit Boole's reasoning regarding the equation ``$x.x=x$'' that sowed the seeds of classical logic. We discuss how he considered both ``$0.0=0$'' and ``$0.0\neq 0$'' in the ``same process of reasoning''. This can either be seen as a contradiction, or it can be seen as a situation where Boole could not decide whether ``$0.0=0$'' is universally valid -- an elementary ``decision problem'' in the words of Hilbert and Ackermann. We conclude that Boole's reasoning, that included a choice of ignorance, was founded upon the middle way of the Buddha, later mastered by Nagarjuna. From the modern standpoint, the situation can be likened to Turing's halting problem which resulted from the use of automatic machines and the exclusion of choice machines.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we investigate the possible scenarios in which a number does not satisfy the Collatz Conjecture. Specifically, we examine numbers which may have a looping Collatz reduction sequence as well as numbers which may lead to a diverging Collatz reduction sequence. In order to investigate these, we look at the parity of the numbers in a general Collatz reduction sequence. Further, we examine cases in which these parity cycles repeat themselves infinitely in the reduction sequence. Through the research conducted in the paper, we formulate a necessary condition for looping in the Collatz Conjecture. We also prove that if a number has a diverging reduction sequence, then it must generate an infinite non-repeating parity cycle.</div>

<div class='title'>Rigorous Proof for Riemann Hypothesis Obtained by Adopting Algebra-Geometry Approach in Geometric Langlands Program</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/john_yuk_ching_ting">John Yuk Ching Ting</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The 1859 Riemann hypothesis conjectured all nontrivial zeros in Riemann zeta function are uniquely located on sigma = 1/2 critical line. Derived from Dirichlet eta function [proxy for Riemann zeta function] are, in chronological order, simplified Dirichlet eta function and Dirichlet Sigma-Power Law. Computed Zeroes from the former uniquely occur at sigma = 1/2 resulting in total summation of fractional exponent (-sigma) that is twice present in this function to be integer -1. Computed Pseudo-zeroes from the later uniquely occur at sigma = 1/2 resulting in total summation of fractional exponent (1 - sigma) that is twice present in this law to be integer 1. All nontrivial zeros are, respectively, obtained directly and indirectly as the one specific type of Zeroes and Pseudo-zeroes only when sigma = 1/2. Thus, it is proved (using equation-type proof) that Riemann hypothesis is true whereby this function and law rigidly comply with Principle of Maximum Density for Integer Number Solutions. The geometrical-mathematical [unified] approach used in our proof is equivalent to the algebra-geometry [unified] approach of geometric Langlands program that was formalized by Professor Peter Scholze and Professor Laurent Fargues. A succinct treatise on proofs for Polignac's and Twin prime conjectures (using algorithm-type proofs) is also outlined in this anniversary research paper.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Given &#8220;ab = 0&#8221;, considering the arithmetic truth &#8220;0.0 = 0&#8221; we conclude that one possibility is &#8220;both a = 0 and b = 0&#8221;. Consequently, the roots of a quadratic equation are mutually inclusive. Therefore, the concerned variable can acquire multiple identities in the same process of reasoning or, at the same time. The law of identity gets violated, which we call the problem of identity. In current practice such a step of reasoning is ignored by choice, resulting in the subsequent denial of &#8220;0.0 = 0&#8221;. Here, we deal with the problem of identity without making such a choice of ignorance. We demonstrate that the concept &#8220;identity of a variable&#8221; is meaningful only in a given context and does not have any significance in isolation other than the symbol, that symbolizes the variable, itself. We demonstrate visually how we actually realize multiple identities of a variable at the same time, in practice, in the context of a given quadratic equation. In this work we lay the foundations, based on which we intend to bring forth some hitherto unattended facets of reasoning that concern two basic differential equations which are pivotal to the literature of physics.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this article, we recall the Fibonacci sequence, the golden ratio, their properties and applications, and some early generalizations of the golden ratio. The Fibonacci sequence is a 2-sequence because it is generated by the sum of two previous terms. As a natural extension of this, we introduce several typical p-sequences where every term is the sum of p-previous terms given p initial values called seeds. In particular, we introduce the notion of 1-sequence. We then discuss generating functions and limiting ratio values of p-sequences. Furthermore, inspired by Fibonacci's rabbit pair problem, we consider a general problem whose particular cases lead to nontrivial additive sequences.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we proved that Non-deterministic Polynomial time complexity (NP) is not equal to Polynomial time complexity (P). We developed the Boolean algebra that will infer the solution of two variables of a Non-deterministic Polynomial computation time Markov Random Field. We showed that no matter how we simplified the Boolean algebra, it can never run in Polynomial computation time (NP not equal to P). We also developed proof that all Polynomial computation time multi-layer Boolean algebra can be transformed to another Polynomial computation time multi-layer Boolean algebra where there are only 'Not' operations in the first layer. So in the process of simplifying the Boolean algebra, we only need to consider factorization operations that only assumes only 'Not' operations in the first layer. We also developed Polynomial computation time Boolean algebra for Markov Random Field Chain and 2sat problem represented in Markov Random Field form to give examples of Polynomial computation time Markov Random Field.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/m_j_kronenburg">M.J. Kronenburg</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The principal inverse tangent and cotangent functions for complex arguments can be defined as formulas involving principal natural logarithms, but these are not odd on the imaginary axis, which they must be according to their definitions as inverse functions. These formulas are therefore modified in such a way that they become odd on the imaginary axis, by choosing the other branch on the lower branch cut, and the corresponding addition formulas for complex and real arguments are derived. With these addition formulas their values on their branch cuts are determined, confirming these modified formulas. Some new formulas for the (hyperbolic) inverse tangent and cotangent functions for complex arguments and some new addition formulas for these functions for real arguments are derived. Some new formulas for the inverse sine and cosine functions and their connections with the inverse tangent and cotangent functions for complex arguments are provided, and from these some new addition formulas for the inverse sine and cosine functions for real arguments are derived. Some duplication and bisection formulas for the inverse tangent, cotangent, sine and cosine functions are derived.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alexis_zaganidis">Alexis Zaganidis</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We define the super-normal-irreducible-irrational numbers from some irreducible-irrational numbers and with the help of the $n$-irreducible sequents (see my previous articles). Instead of taking some integer part of the irreducible-irrational number (or from its inverse), we add a super-normal-irreducible formula which give the position of the first digit breaking some super-normal number definition. From $84$ irreducible-irrational numbers, we deduce from the axiom at second-order of logic that they are all super-normal numbers as well. Moreover, with some random digits, the probability that the super-normal-irreducible formula holds for the $84$ ones is about $9.0\times 10^{-10}$ and we have taken in account that some irreducible-irrational numbers are only some different functions of the same irreducible-irrational number. From this large coincidence, we introduce the axiom at third-order of logic which states that every irreducible-irrational numbers are super-normal numbers as well. From that new axiom at third-order of logic, we deduce the none-existence of an exotic $4$-sphere. Finally, we conclude about the finitude of the total number of $n$-irreducible sequents.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We commence this paper by outlining the manifested Chaos and Fractal phenomena derived from our concocted idiom &quot;Complexity arising from Life at the Edge of Chaos-Fractal&quot;. COVID-19 originated from Wuhan, China in December 2019. Declared by World Health Organization on March 11, 2020; COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented negative global impacts on health and economy. With China and US playing crucial roles, international cooperation is required to combat this &quot;Incompletely Predictable&quot; pandemic. We mathematically model COVID-19 and solve [unconnected] below-mentioned open problems in Number theory using our versatile Fic-Fac Ratio. Computed as Information-based complexity, our innovative Information-complexity conservation constitutes a unique all-purpose analytic tool associated with Mathematics for Incompletely Predictable problems. These problems are literally &quot;complex systems&quot; containing well-defined Incompletely Predictable entities such as nontrivial zeros and two types of Gram points in Riemann zeta function (or its proxy Dirichlet eta function) together with prime and composite numbers from Sieve of Eratosthenes. Correct and complete mathematical arguments for first key step of converting this function into its continuous format version, and second key step of using our unique Dimension (2x-N) system instead of this Sieve result in primary spin-offs from first key step consisting of providing proof for Riemann hypothesis (and explaining closely related two types of Gram points), and second key step consisting of providing proofs for Polignac's and Twin prime conjectures.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Card tricks can be entertaining to audiences.

<div class='title'>Differential Correction and Arc-Length Continuation Applied to Boundary Value Problems: Examples Based on Snap-Through of Circular Arches and Spherical Shell</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jun_zhong">Jun Zhong</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/shane_d_ross">Shane D. Ross</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Inspired by the application of differential correction to initial-value problems to find periodic orbits in both the autonomous and non-autonomous dynamical systems, in this paper we apply differential correction to boundary-value problems. In the numerical demonstration, the snap-through buckling of arches and shallow spherical shells in structural mechanics are selected as examples. Due to the complicated geometrical nonlinearity in such problems, the limit points and turning points might exist. In this case, the typical Newton-Raphson method commonly used in numerical algorithms will fail to cross such points. In the current study, an arc-length continuation is introduced to enable the current algorithm to capture the complicated load-deflection paths. To show the accuracy and efficiency of differential correction, we will also apply the continuation software package COCO to get the results as a comparison to those from differential correction. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm and COCO agree well with each other, suggesting the validity and robustness of differential correction for boundary-value problems.</div>

<div class='abstract'>It&#8217;s well known that every prime number $p \geq 5$ has the form $6k-1$ or $6k+1$. We&#8217;ll call $k$ the generator of $p$. Twin primes are distinghuished due to a common generator for each pair. Therefore it makes sense to search for the twin primes on the level of their generators. The present paper developes a sieve method to extract all twin primes on the level of their generators. On this basis important properties of the set of the twin prime generators will be studied. Finally the Twin Prime Conjecture is proved based on the studied properties.</div>

<div class='title'>Symmetries in Foundation of Quantum Theory and Mathematics</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/felix_m_lev">Felix M. Lev</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In standard quantum theory, symmetry is defined in the spirit of Klein's Erlangen Program: the background space has a symmetry group, and the basic operators should commute according to the Lie algebra of that group. We argue that the definition should be the opposite: background space has a direct physical meaning only on classical level while on quantum level symmetry should be defined by a Lie algebra of basic operators. Then the fact that de Sitter symmetry is more general than Poincare one can be proved mathematically. The problem of explaining cosmological acceleration is very difficult but, as follows from our results, there exists a scenario that the phenomenon of cosmological acceleration can be explained proceeding from basic principles of quantum theory. The explanation has nothing to do with existence or nonexistence of dark energy and therefore the cosmological constant problem and the dark energy problem do not arise. We consider finite quantum theory (FQT) where states are elements of a space over a finite ring or field with characteristic $p$ and operators of physical quantities act in this space. We prove that, with the same approach to symmetry, FQT and finite mathematics are more general than standard quantum theory and classical mathematics, respectively: the latter theories are special degenerated cases of the former ones in the formal limit $p\to\infty$.</div>

<div class='title'>From Periods to Anabelian Geometry and Quantum Amplitudes</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/lucian_m_ionescu">Lucian M. Ionescu</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>To better understand and investigate Kontsevich-Zagier conjecture on abstract periods, we consider the case of algebraic Riemann Surfaces representable by Belyi maps. The category of morphisms of Belyi ramified maps and Dessins D'Enfant, will be investigated in search of an analog for periods, of the Ramification Theory for decomposition of primes in field extensions, controlled by theirs respective algebraic Galois groups. This suggests a relation between the theory of (cohomological, Betti-de Rham) periods and Grothendieck's Anabelian Geometry (homotopical/ local systems), towards perhaps an algebraic analog of Hurwitz Theorem, relating the the algebraic de Rham cohomology and algebraic fundamental group, both pioneered by A. Grothendieck. There seem to be good prospects of better understanding the role of absolute Galois group in the physics context of scattering amplitudes and Multiple Zeta Values, with their incarnation as Chen integrals on moduli spaces, as studied by Francis Brown, since the latter are a homotopical analog of de Rham Theory. The research will be placed in the larger context of the ADE-correspondence, since, for example, orbifolds of finite groups of rotations have crepant resolutions relevant in String Theory, while via Cartan-Killing Theory and exceptional Lie algebras, they relate to TOEs. Relations with the author's reformulation of cohomology of cyclic groups as a discrete analog of de Rham cohomology and the Arithmetic Galois Theory will provide a purely algebraic toy-model of the said algebraic homology/homotopy group theory of Grothendieck as part of Anabelian Geometry. It will allow an elementary investigation of the main concepts defining periods and algebraic fundamental group, together with their conceptual relation to algebraic numbers and Galois groups. The Riemann surfaces with Platonic tessellations, especially the Hurwitz surfaces, are related to the finite Hopf sub-bundles with symmetries the ``exceptional'' Galois groups. The corresponding Platonic Trinity leads to connections with ADE-correspondence, and beyond, e.g. TOEs and ADEX-Theory. Quantizing &quot;everything&quot; (cyclotomic quantum phase and finite Platonic-Hurwitz geometry of qubits/baryons) could perhaps be The Eightfold (Petrie polygon) Way to finally understand what quark flavors and fermion generations really are.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Hypercomplex numbers are, roughly speaking, numbers of the form x_1 + i_1x_2 + &#8230; + i_nx_{n+1} such that x_1 + i_1x_2 + &#8230; + i_nx_{n+1} = y_1 + i_1y_2 + &#8230; + i_ny_{n+1} if and only if x_j = y_j for all j in {1,2,&#8230;,n}.

These numbers have some interesting properties. In particular, in this paper I prove a generalized form of the Demoivre&#8217;s formula for these numbers, and determine certain conditions required for a function on a Quadratic Anticommutative Hypercomplex plane to be analytic&#8212;including generalizations of the Cauchy-Riemann equations.</div>

<div class='title'>Mathematics as Information Compression Via the Matching and Unification of Patterns</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/j_gerard_wolff">J Gerard Wolff</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper describes a novel perspective on the foundations of mathematics: how mathematics may be seen to be largely about &quot;information compression (IC) via the matching and unification of patterns&quot; (ICMUP). That is itself a novel approach to IC, couched in terms of non-mathematical primitives, as is necessary in any investigation of the foundations of mathematics. This new perspective on the foundations of mathematics reflects the idea that, as an aid to human thinking, mathematics is likely to be consonant with much evidence for the importance of IC in human learning, perception, and cognition. This perspective on the foundations of mathematics has grown out of a long-term programme of research developing the &quot;SP Theory of Intelligence&quot; and its realisation in the &quot;SP Computer Model&quot;, a system in which a generalised version of ICMUP -- the powerful concept of &quot;SP-multiple-alignment&quot; -- plays a central role. The paper shows with an example how mathematics, without any special provision, may achieve compression of information. Then it describes examples showing how variants of ICMUP may be seen in widely-used structures and operations in mathematics. Examples are also given to show how several aspects of the mathematics-related disciplines of logic and computing may be understood as ICMUP. Also discussed is the intimate relation between IC and concepts of probability, with arguments that there are advantages in approaching AI, cognitive science, and concepts of probability via ICMUP. Also discussed is how the close relation between IC and concepts of probability relates to the established view that some parts of mathematics are intrinsically probabilistic, and how that latter view may be reconciled with the all-or-nothing, &quot;exact&quot;, forms of calculation or inference that are familiar in mathematics and logic. There are many potential benefits and applications of the mathematics-as-IC perspective.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Lagrangian techniques, such as the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) and hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures, have become popular tools for analyzing unsteady fluid flows. These techniques identify regions where particles transported by a flow will converge to and diverge from over a finite-time interval, even in a divergence-free flow. Lagrangian analyses, however, are time consuming and computationally expensive, hence unsuitable for quickly assessing short-term material transport. A recently developed method called OECSs rigorously connected Eulerian quantities to short-term Lagrangian transport. This Eulerian method is faster and less expensive to compute than its Lagrangian counterparts, and needs only a single snapshot of a velocity field. Along the same line, here we define the instantaneous Lyapunov Exponent (iLE), the instantaneous counterpart of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE), and connect the Taylor series expansion of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor to the infinitesimal integration time limit of the FTLE.

<div class='abstract'>Up to now, I have tried to expand this equation and prove Riemann hypothesis with the equation of cos, sin, but the proof was impossible. However, I realized that a simple formula before expansion can prove it. The real value is zero only when the real part of s is 1/2. Non-trivial zeros must always have a real value of zero. The real part of s being 1/2 is the minimum requirement for s to be a non-trivial zeros.</div>

<div class='title'>Mathematics as Information Compression Via the Matching and Unication of Patterns</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/j_gerard_wolff">J Gerard Wolff</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper describes a novel perspective on the foundations of mathematics: how mathematics may be seen to be largely about 'information compression (IC) via the matching and unification of patterns' (ICMUP. That is itself a novel approach to IC, couched in terms of non-mathematical primitives, as is necessary in any investigation of the foundations of mathematics. This new perspective on the foundations of mathematics reects the idea that, as an aid to human thinking, mathematics is likely to be consonant with much evidence for the importance of IC in human learning, perception, and cognition. This perspective on the foundations of mathematics has grown out of a long-term programme of research developing the SP Theory of Intelligence and its realisation in the SP Computer Model, a system in which a generalised version of ICMUP -- the powerful concept of SP-multiple-alignment -- plays a central role. The paper shows with an example how mathematics, without any special provision, may achieve compression of information. Then it describes examples showing how variants of ICMUP may be seen in widely-used structures and operations in mathematics. Examples are also given to show how several aspects of the mathematics-related disciplines of logic and computing may be understood as ICMUP. Also discussed is the intimate relation between IC and concepts of probability, witharguments that there are advantages in approaching AI, cognitive science, and concepts of probability via ICMUP. Also discussed is how the close relation between IC and concepts of probability relates to the established view that some parts of mathematics are intrinsically probabilistic, and how that latter view may be reconciled with the all-or-nothing, 'exact', forms of calculation or inference that are familiar in mathematics and logic. There are many potential benefits and applications of the mathematics-as-IC perspective.</div>

<div class='abstract'>How may we find a transition matrix that guarantees the long-run convergence of a Markov Chain to a given stationary distribution? Solving for this (usually) undetermined system is non-trivial and presents unique computational challenges. Five different of methods of directly solving for a transition matrix are presented along with their limitations. Relaxations of the two core assumptions underlying these direct methods - the Identityless and Independence Assumptions - are considered. A method of generating a Mass Matrix - the transition matrix underlying hops between entire population states - is described while developing the notion of successively-bounded weak compositions. An algorithm for their exhaustive generation is also presented. Applications of some methods are provided with respect to optimizing firm profit via optimally distributing workers among wage brackets and optimizing measures of national wealth via manipulation of class distribution and immigration policy. A generalization of all applications is formulated.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In a stochastic mapping model, a method is described for interpolating un-sampled mapping probabilities given a successive set of observed mappings. The sampled probabilities are calculated from the observed mappings. The previously described method of interpolating values in code space is used to interpolate the un-observed mapping probabilities. The outcomes for subsequent mappings can then be predicted by finding the processes with maximal interpolated probability. Finally, a software package is created and demonstrated to implement the method and tested on a variety of situations for filling in missing element values or categorising data arrays.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This poster investigates the characteristics of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (of s) in the critical strip by using the Dirichlet eta function, which has the same zeros. The characteristics of the implicit functions for the real and imaginary components when those components are equal are investigated and it is shown that the function describing the value of the real component when the real and imaginary components are equal has a derivative that does not change sign along any of its individual curves - meaning that each value of the imaginary part of s produces at most one zero. Combined with the fact that the zeros of the Riemann xi function are also the zeros of the zeta function and xi(s) = xi(1-s), this leads to the conclusion that the Riemann Hypothesis is true.</div>

In view of the matrix version of the restricted isometry property (RIP) and the Frobenius-robust rank null space property (FRNSP), this paper extends the investigation to a completely perturbed model taking into consideration not only noise but also perturbation, derives sufficient conditions guaranteeing that low-rank matrices can be robustly and stably reconstructed under the completely perturbed scenario, as well as finally presents an upper bound estimation of recovery error. The upper bound estimation can be described by two terms, one concerning the total noise, and another regarding the best $r$-approximation error. Specially, we not only improve the condition corresponding with RIP, but also ameliorate the upper bound estimation in case the results reduce to the general case. Furthermore, in the case of $\mathcal{E}=0$, the obtaining conditions are optimal.</div>

<div class='title'>A Simple Proof That Finite Quantum Theory And Finite Mathematics Are More Fundamental Than Standard Quantum Theory And Classical Mathematics, Respectively</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/felix_m_lev">Felix M. Lev</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Standard quantum theory is based on classical mathematics involving such notions as infinitely small/large and continuity. Those notions were proposed by Newton and Leibniz more than 300 years ago when people believed that every object can be divided by an arbitrarily large number of arbitrarily small parts. However, now it is obvious that when we reach the level of atoms and elementary particles then standard division loses its meaning and in nature there are no infinitely small objects and no continuity. In our previous publications we proposed a version of finite quantum theory (FQT) based on a finite ring or field with characteristic $p$. In the present paper we first define the notion when theory A is more general than theory B and theory B is a special degenerate case of theory A. Then we prove that standard quantum theory is a special degenerate case of FQT in the formal limit $p\to\infty$. Since quantum theory is the most general physics theory, this implies that classical mathematics itself is a special degenerate case of finite mathematics in the formal limit when the characteristic of the ring or field in the latter goes to infinity. In general, introducing infinity automatically implies transition to a degenerate theory because in that case all operations modulo a number are lost. So, {\it even from the pure mathematical point of view}, the very notion of infinity cannot be fundamental, and theories involving infinities can be only approximations to more general theories. Motivation and implications are discussed.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we theoretically investigate the low-rank matrix recovery problem in the context of the unconstrained regularized nuclear norm minimization (RNNM) framework. Our theoretical findings show that, one can robustly recover any matrix X from its few noisy measurements b=A(X)+n with a bounded constraint ||n||_{2}&lt;&#949; via the RNNM, if the linear map A satisfies restricted isometry property (RIP) with &#948;_{tk}&lt;&#8730;(t-1)/t for certain fixed t&gt;1. Recently, this condition with t&#8805;4/3 has been proved by Cai and Zhang (2014) to be sharp for exactly recovering any rank-k matrices via the constrained nuclear norm minimization (NNM). To the best of our knowledge, our work first extends nontrivially this recovery condition for the constrained NNM to that for its unconstrained counterpart. Furthermore, it will be shown that similar recovery condition also holds for regularized l_{1}-norm minimization, which sometimes is also called Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN).</div>

<div class='abstract'>The essential task of multi-dimensional data analysis focuses on the tensor decomposition and the corresponding notion of rank. However, most tensor ranks are not well defined with a tight convex relaxation. In this paper, by introducing the notion of tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), we establish a regularized tensor nuclear norm minimization (RTNNM) model for low tubal rank tensor recovery. In addition, the tensor nuclear norm within the unit ball of the tensor spectral norm here has been shown to be a convex envelop of tensor average rank. On the other hand, many variants of the restricted isometry property (RIP) have proven to be crucial frameworks and analysis tools for recovery of sparse vectors and low-rank tensors. So, we initiatively define a novel tensor restrict isometry property (t-RIP) based on t-SVD. Besides, our theoretical results show that any third-order tensor X&#8712;R^{n_{1}&#215; n_{2}&#215; n_{3}} whose tubal rank is at most r can stably be recovered from its as few as measurements y = M(X)+w with a bounded noise constraint ||w||_{2}&#8804;&#949; via the RTNNM model, if the linear map M obeys t-RIP with &#948;_{tr}^{M}&lt;&#8730;&#65288;t-1&#65289;/(n_{3}^{2}+t-1) for certain fixed t&gt;1.

<div class='abstract'>Lagrangian diagnostics, such as the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and Lagrangian coherent structures, have become popular tools for analyzing unsteady fluid flows. These diagnostics can help illuminate regions where particles transported by a flow will converge to and diverge from, even in a divergence-free flow. Unfortunately, calculating Lagrangian diagnostics can be time consuming and computationally expensive. Recently, new Eulerian diagnostics have been developed which provide similar insights into the Lagrangian transport properties of fluid flows. These new diagnostics are faster and less expensive to compute than their Lagrangian counterparts. Because Eulerian diagnostics of Lagrangian transport structure are relatively new, there is still much about their connection to Lagrangian diagnostics that is unknown. This paper provides a mathematical bridge between Lagrangian and Eulerian diagnostics. It rigorously explores the mathematical relationship that exists between invariants of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor and the Rivlin-Ericksen tensors, primarily the Eulerian rate-of-strain tensor, in the infinitesimal integration time limit. Additionally, this paper develops the infinitesimal-time Lagrangian coherent structures (iLCSs) and demonstrates their efficacy in predicting the Lagrangian transport of particles even in realistic geophysical fluid flows generated by numerical models.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Interval neutrosophic fuzzy decision making is an important part of decision making under uncertainty, which is based on preference order. In this study, a new multi-valued interval neutrosophic fuzzy multiple attribute decision making method has been developed by integrating the DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) method and the TOPSIS (the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) method. Evaluation values are given in the form of multi-valued interval neutrosophic fuzzy values. By using DEMATEL, dependencies among attributes can be modeled, and attribute weights are determined.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Neutrosophic cubic sets are the more generalized tool by which one can handle imprecise information in a more effective way as compared to fuzzy sets and all other versions of fuzzy sets. Neutrosophic cubic sets have the more flexibility, precision and compatibility to the system as compared to previous existing fuzzy models. On the other hand the graphs represent a problem physically in the form of diagrams, matrices etc. which is very easy to understand and handle.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Rough set theory and neutrosophic set theory are mathematical models to deal with incomplete and vague information. These two theories can be combined into a framework for modeling and processing incomplete information in information systems. Thus, the neutrosophic rough set hybrid model gives more precision, flexibility and compatibility to the system as compared to the classic and fuzzy models. In this research study, we develop neutrosophic rough digraphs based on the neutrosophic rough hybrid model. Moreover, we discuss regular neutrosophic rough digraphs, and we solve decision-making problems by using our proposed hybrid model. Finally, we give a comparison analysis of two hybrid models, namely, neutrosophic rough digraphs and rough neutrosophic digraphs.</div>

<div class='abstract'>As far as I know, there is no a study on fractals on non euclidean metrics.This paper proposes a first approach method about generating fractals on a non-euclidean metric. The idea is to extend the calculus of fractals on non-euclidean metrics. Using the Riemann metric, there will be defined a non-euclidean modulo of a complex number in order to check the divergence of the series generated by the Mandelbrot set. It also shown that the fractals are not invariant versus rotations. The study will be extended to the quaternions, where is shown that the study of fractals might not be extended to quaternions with a general metric because of the high divergence of the series (a condition in order to generate a fractal is selecting bounded operators). Finally, a Java program will be found as example to show those kind of fractals, where any metric can be defined, so it will be helpful to study those properties.</div>

NNF circuit have symmetry of OR-gate input line, so NNF circuit cannot identify from OR-gate output line which of OR-gate input line is 1. So NNF circuit family cannot compute sandwich structure effectively (Sandwich structure is two accept inputs that sandwich reject inputs in Hamming space). NNF circuit have to use unique AND-gate to identify each different vector of sandwich structure. That is, we can measure problem complexity by counting different vectors. Some decision problem have characteristic in sandwich structure. Different vectors of Negate HornSAT problem are at most constant length because we can delete constant part of each negative literal in Horn clauses by using definite clauses. Therefore, number of these different vector is at most polynomial size. The other hand, we can design high complexity problem with almost perfct nonlinear (APN) function.</div>

<div class='title'>Almost All Monotone Circuit Family</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/koji_kobayashi">Koji KOBAYASHI</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper describes about &quot;Almost all monotone circuit family&quot; and introduce its interesting advantages to measuring problem complexity. Explained in Michael Sipser &quot;Introduction to the Theory of COMPUTATION&quot;, circuit family that emulate Deterministic Turing machine (DTM) are almost all monotone circuit family except some NOT-gate that connect input variables (like negation normal form (NNF)). This &quot;NNF Circuit family&quot; have good characteristic which present each accept input exclusivity and symmetry. Each input make some INPUT-gate and NOT-gate output 1 which set is different from another input, and meet these output in OR-gate and finally connect (specified) OUTPUT-gate. That is, NNF circuit start accept input that exclusive each other, and meet each input as symmetry input step by step and finally goal same output. Especially, some different variables which sandwich reject inputs correspond to unique AND-gate. That is, we can measure problem complexity by using different variables of accept inputs. For examples, such number of different variables type of negation HornSAT is at most polynomial size. This is one of reason that we can compute P problem easily.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper describes about complexity of PH problems by using &quot;Almost all monotone circuit family&quot; and &quot;Accept input pair that sandwich reject inputs&quot;. Explained in Michael Sipser &quot;Introduction to the Theory of COMPUTATION&quot;, circuit family that emulate Deterministic Turing machine (DTM) are almost all monotone circuit family except some NOT-gate that connect input variables (like negation normal form (NNF)). Therefore, we can find out DTM limitation by using this &quot;NNF Circuit family&quot;. To clarify NNF circuit family limitation, we pay attention to AND-gate and OR-gate relation. If two accept &quot;Neighbor input&quot; pair that sandwich reject &quot;Boundary input&quot; in Hamming distance, NNF circuit have to meet these different variables of neighbor inputs in AND-gate to differentiate boundary inputs. NNF circuit have to use unique AND-gate to identify such neighbor input. The other hand, we can make neighbor input problem &quot;Neighbor Tautology DNF problem (NTD)&quot; in PH. NTD is subset of tautology DNF that do not become tautology if proper subset of one variable permutate positive / negative. NTD include many different variables which number is over polynomial size of input length. Therefore NNF circuit family that compute NTD are over polynomial size of length, and NTD that include PH is not in P.</div>

<div class='abstract'>A single-valued neutrosophic set has king power to express uncertainty characterized by indeterminacy, inconsistency and incompleteness. Most of the existing single-valued neutrosophic cross entropy bears an asymmetrical behavior and produces an undefined phenomenon in some situations. In order to deal with these disadvantages, we propose a new cross entropy measure under a single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) environment, namely NS-cross entropy, and prove its basic properties.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper investigates the characteristics of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (of s) in the critical strip by using the Dirichlet eta function, which has the same zeros. The characteristics of the implicit functions for the real and imaginary components when those components are equal are investigated and it is shown that the function describing the value of the real component when the real and imaginary components are equal has a derivative that does not change sign along any of its individual curves - meaning that each value of the imaginary part of s produces at most one zero. Combined with the fact that the zeros of the Riemann xi function are also the zeros of the zeta function and xi(s) = xi(1-s), this leads to the conclusion that the Riemann Hypothesis is true.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The aim of this paper is to provide a contribution to Natural Logic and Neutrosophic Theory. This paper considers lattice structures built on noun phrases. Firstly, we present some new negations of intersective adjectival phrases and their settheoretic semantics such as non-red non-cars and red non-cars. Secondly, a lattice structure is built on positive and negative nouns and their positive and negative intersective adjectival phrases. Thirdly, a richer lattice is obtained from previous one by adding neutrosophic prefixes neut and anti to intersective adjectival phrases. Finally, the richest lattice is constructed via extending the previous lattice structures by private adjectives (fake, counterfeit). We call these lattice classes Neutrosophic Linguistic Lattices (NLL).</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/koji_kobayashi">Koji KOBAYASHI</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper describes about complexity of NP problems by using &#8220;Effective circuit&#8221; independency, and apply SAT problem. Inputs of circuit family that compute P problem have some explicit symmetry that indicated circuit structure. To clarify this explict symmetry, we define &#8220;Effective circuit&#8221; as partial circuit which are necessary to compute target inputs. Effective circuit set divide problem to some symmetric partial problems. The other hand, inputs of NTM that compute NP problem have extra implicit symmetry that indicated nondeterministic transition functions. To clarify this implicit symmetry, we define special DTM &#8220;Concrete DTM&#8221;which index i correspond to selection of nondeterministic transition functions. That is, NTM split many different asymmetry DTM and compute all DTM in same time. Consider concrete DTM and effective circuit set, circuit family [SAT] that solve SAT problem have to include all effective circuit set [CVPi] that correspond to concrete DTM as Circuit Value Problem. [CVPi] have unique gate and [SAT] must include all [CVPi]. Number of [CVPi] is over polynomial size of input. Therefore, [SAT] is over polynomial size.</div>

In this paper, we mainly investigate the topological structures of single valued neutrosophic rough sets which is constructed by combining SVNSs and rough sets.

There are two main contributions of this work. One is a new method to transform the single valued neutrosophic set into basic probability assignment.

<div class='abstract'>Uncertainties play a dominant role during the aggregation process and hence their corresponding decisions are made fuzzier. Single-value neutrosophic numbers (SVNNs) contain the three ranges: truth, indeterminacy, and falsity membership degrees, and are very useful for describing and handling the uncertainties in the day-to-day life situations. In this study, some operations of SVNNs such as sum, product, and scalar multiplication are defined under Frank norm operations and, based on it, some averaging and geometric aggregation operators have been developed. We further establish some of its properties. Moreover, a decision-making method based on the proposed operators is established and illustrated with a numerical example.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we introduce the concept of complex multi-fuzzy sets (CMkFSs) as a generalization of the concept of multi-fuzzy sets by adding the phase term to the definition of multi-fuzzy sets. In other words, we extend the range of multi-membership function from the interval [0,1] to unit circle in the complex plane. The novelty of CMkFSs lies in the ability of complex multi- membership functions to achieve more range of values while handling uncertainty of data that is periodic in nature. The basic operations on CMkFSs, namely complement, union, intersection, product and Cartesian product are studied along with accompanying examples. Properties of these operations are derived. Finally, we introduce the intuitive definition of the distance measure between two complex multi-fuzzy sets which are used to define &#948;-equalities of complex multi-fuzzy sets.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Classical logic is typically concerned with abstract analysis. The problem for a synthetic logic is to transcend and unify available data to reconstruct the object as a totality. Three rules are proposed to pass from classic logic to synthetic logic. We present the category logic of qualitative opposition using examples from various sciences. This logic has been defined to include the neuter as part of qualitative opposition. The application of these rules to qualitative opposition, and, in particular, its neuter, demonstrated that a synthetic logic allows the truth of some contradictions. This synthetic logic is dialectical with a multi-valued logic, which gives every proposition a truth value in the interval [0,1] that is the square of the modulus of a complex number. In this dialectical logic, contradictions of the neuter of an opposition may be true.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/andrej_liptaj">Andrej Liptaj</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>If several independent algorithms for a computer-calculated quantity exist, then one can expect their results (which differ because of numerical errors) to follow approximately Gaussian distribution. The mean of this distribution, interpreted as the value of the quantity of interest, can be determined with much better precision than what is the precision provided by a single algorithm. Many practical algorithms introduce a bias using a parameter, e.g. a small but finite number to compute a limit or a large but finite number (cutoff) to approximate infinity. One may vary such parameter of a single algorithm, interpret the resulting numbers as generated by several algorithms and compute the average. A numerical evidence for the validity of this approach is, in the context of a fixed machine epsilon, shown for differentiation: the method greatly improves the precision and leads, presumably, to the most precise numerical differentiation nowadays known.</div>

<div class='abstract'>By studying the holomorphic structure of automorphic inverse property quasigroups and loops[AIPQ and (AIPL)] and cross inverse property quasigroups and loops[CIPQ and (CIPL)], it is established that the holomorph of a loop is a Smarandache; AIPL, CIPL, K-loop, Bruck-loop or Kikkawa-loop if and only if its Smarandache automorphism group is trivial and the loop is itself is a Smarandache; AIPL, CIPL, K-loop, Bruck-loop or Kikkawa-loop.</div>

<div class='title'>A Pair of Smarandachely Isotopic Quasigroups and Loops Of The Same Variety</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/temotope_gbolahan_jayeola">Temotope Gbolahan Jayeola</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The isotopic invariance or universality of types and varieties of quasigroups and loops described by one or more equivalent identities has been of interest to researchers in loop theory in the recent past. A variety of quasigroups(loops) that are not universal have been found to be isotopic invariant relative to a special type of isotopism or the other. Presently, there are two outstanding open problems on universality of loops: semi automorphic inverse property loops(1999) and Osborn loops(2005). Smarandache isotopism(S-isotopism) was originally introduced by Vasantha Kandasamy in 2002.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Classical mathematics (involving such notions as infinitely small/large and continuity) is usually treated as fundamental while finite mathematics is treated as inferior which is used only in special applications. We first argue that the situation is the opposite: classical mathematics is only a degenerate special case of finite one and finite mathematics is more pertinent for describing nature than standard one. Then we describe results of a quantum theory based on finite mathematics. Implications for foundation of mathematics are discussed.</div>

The concepts of product bipolar fuzzy multigraphs (PBFMGs), product bipolar fuzzy planar graphs (PBFPGs) and product bipolar fuzzy dual graphs (PBFDGs) are introduced and investigated. Product bipolar fuzzy planarity value of PBFPG is introduced. The relation between PBFPG and PBFDG is also established. Isomorphism between PBFPGs is discussed.

This is done as follows. By constructing two S-isotopic S-quasigroups(loops) U and V such that their Smarandache automorphism groups are not trivial, it is shown that U is a SCIPQ(SCIPL) if and only if V is a SCIPQ(SCIPL). Explanations and procedures are given on how these SCIPQs can be used to double encrypt information.</div>

Then, the objective weights of various parameters are determined via grey system theory. Combining objective weights with subjective weights, we present the combined weights, which can re&#64258;ect both the subjective considerations of the decision maker and the objective information.

<div class='abstract'>Many practical computing problems concern large graphs. Some examples include the Web graphs, various social networks and molecular datasets. The scale of these graphs introduces challenges to their ecient processing. One of the main issues in such problems is that most of the mentioned datasets cannot be t in the memory. In this paper, we present a new data fragment framework for graph mining. The original dataset is divided into a xed number of fragments, associated with the number of the graphs in each dataset. Then each fragment is mined individually using a well-known graph mining algorithm (i.e. FSG or gSpan) and the results are combined to generate global results. A major problem in fragmenting graphs is concerning on similarity or dissimilarity of them. Another problem corresponds to the completeness of the output which will be discussed in this paper.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The standard harmonic balance method consists in expanding the displacement of an oscillator as a Fourier cosine series in time. A key modification is proposed here, in which the conservative force is additionally expanded as a Fourier sine series in space. As a result, the steady-state oscillation frequency can be expressed in terms of a Bessel series, and the sums of many such series are known or can be developed. The method is illustrated for five different physical situations, including a ball rolling inside a V-shaped ramp, an electron attracted to a charged filament, a large-amplitude pendulum, and a During oscillator. As an example of the results, the predicted period of a simple pendulum swinging between -90&#176; and +90&#176; is found to be only 0.4% larger than the exact value. Even better, the predicted frequency for the V-ramp case turns out to be exact.</div>

<div class='abstract'>To make a decision under certainty, multicriteria decision methods aims to choose, rank or sort alternatives on the basis of quantitative or qualitative criteria and preferences expressed by the decision-makers. However, decision is often done under uncertainty: choosing alternatives can have different consequences depending on the external context (or state of the word). In this paper, a new methodology called Cautious Ordered Weighted Averaging with Evidential Reasoning (COWA-ER) is proposed for decision making under uncertainty to take into account imperfect evaluations of the alternatives and unknown beliefs about groups of the possible states of the world (scenarii). COWA-ER mixes cautiously the principle of Yager&#8217;s Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) approach with the efficient fusion of belief functions proposed in Dezert-Smarandache Theory DSmT).</div>

The comparisons show that, when we use DSmH in the evidential network, we can assign more Basic Belief Assignments (BBA) to the focal element the target belongs to.

We also found new types of codes and these are pseudo neutrosophic codes and strong or pure neutrosophic codes. By the help of examples, we illustrated in a simple way.

They want to send 11and 00 as codewords. They suppose 11 for true and 00 for false. When the sender sends the these two codewords and the error occures. As a result the reciever recieved 01 or 10 instead of 11 and 00. This story give a way to the neutrosophic codes and thus we introduced neutrosophic codes over finite field in this paper</div>

<div class='abstract'>This article concerns the psychology of the paradoxical Two Envelope Problem. The goal is to find instructive variants of the envelope switching problem that are capable of clear-cut resolution, while still retaining paradoxical features. By relocating the original problem into different contexts involving commutes and playing cards the reader is presented with a succession of resolved paradoxes that reduce the confusion arising from the parent paradox. The goal is to reduce confusion by understanding how we sometimes misread mathematical statements; or, to completely avoid confusion, either by reforming language, or adopting an unambiguous notation for switching problems. This article also suggests that an illusion close in character to the figure/ground illusion hampers our understanding of switching problems in general and helps account for the intense confusion that switching problems sometimes generate.</div>

<div class='title'>Games People Play: an Overview of Strategic Decision-Making Theory in Conflict Situations</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/harris_v_georgiou">Harris V. Georgiou</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, a gentle introduction to Game Theory is presented in the form of basic concepts and examples. Minimax and Nash's theorem are introduced as the formal definitions for optimal strategies and equilibria in zero-sum and nonzero-sum games. Several elements of cooperaive gaming, coalitions, voting ensembles, voting power and collective efficiency are described in brief. Analytical (matrix) and extended (tree-graph) forms of game representation is illustrated as the basic tools for identifying optimal strategies and &#8220;solutions&#8221; in games of any kind. Next, a typology of four standard nonzero-sum games is investigated, analyzing the Nash equilibria and the optimal strategies in each case. Signaling, stance and third-party intermediates are described as very important properties when analyzing strategic moves, while credibility and reputation is described as crucial factors when signaling promises or threats. Utility is introduced as a generalization of typical cost/gain functions and it is used to explain the incentives of irrational players under the scope of &#8220;rational irrationality&#8221;. Finally, a brief reference is presented for several other more advanced concepts of gaming, including emergence of cooperation, evolutionary stable strategies, two-level games, metagames, hypergames and the Harsanyi transformation.</div>

<div class='abstract'>An infinitesimal and infinitary number system the Gossamer numbers is fitted to du Bois-Reymond&#8217;s infinitary calculus, redefining the magnitude relations. We connect the past symbol relations much-less-than and much-less-than or equal to with the present little-o and big-O notation, which have identical definitions. As these definitions are extended, hence we also extend little-o and big-O, which are defined in Gossamer numbers. Notation for an reformed infinitary calculus, calculation at a point is developed. We proceed with the introduction of an extended infinitary calculus.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Development of sum and integral convergence criteria, leading to a representation of the sum or integral as a point at infinity. Application of du Bois-Reymond&#8217;s comparison of functions theory, when it was thought that there were none. Known convergence tests are alternatively stated and some are reformed. Several new convergence tests are developed, including an adaption of L&#8217;Hopital&#8217;s rule. The most general, the boundary test is stated. Thereby we give an overview of a new field we call &#8216;Convergence sums&#8217;.

About NP-Complete problems, we can divide to infinite disjunction of P-Complete problems. These P-Complete problems are independent of each other in disjunction. That is, NP-Complete problem is in infinite dimension function space that bases are P-Complete. The other hand, any P-Complete problem have at most a finite number of P-Complete basis. The reason is that each P problems have at most finite number of Least fixed point operator. Therefore, we cannot describe NP-Complete problems in P. We can also prove this result from incompleteness of P.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper we introduced Smarandache - 2 - algebraic structure of R-Module namely Smarandache - R - Module. A Smarandache - 2 - algebraic structure on a set N means a weak algebraic structure A0 on N such that there exist a proper subset M of N, which is embedded with a stronger algebraic structure A1, stronger algebraic structure means satisfying more axioms, by proper subset one understands a subset from the empty set, from the unit element if any , from the whole set. We dene Smarandache - R - Module and obtain some of its characterization through S - algebra and Morita context. For basic concept we refer to Raul Padilla.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this work, two normal congruences are built on two quasigroups with underlining set Z2 n relative to the linear-bivariate polynomial P(x; y) = a + bx + cy that generates a quasigroup over the ring Zn. Four quasigroups are built using the normal congruences and these are shown to be homomorphic to the quasigroups with underlining set Z2 n. Some subquasigroups of the quasigroups with underlining set Z2 n are also found.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/elemer_e_rosinger">Elemer E Rosinger</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>So far, the order completion method for solving PDEs, introduced in 1990, can solve by far the most general linear and nonlinear systems of PDEs, with possible initial and/or boundary data. Examples of solving various PDEs with the order completion method are presented. Some of such PDEs do not have global solutions by any other known methods, or are even proved not to have such global solutions. The presentation next aims to be as summary, and in fact, sketchy as possible, even if by that it may create some difficulty. However, nowadays, being subjected to an ever growing ``information overload&quot;, that approach may turn out to be not the worst among two bad alternatives. Details can be found in [1], while on the other hand, alternative longer &quot;short presentations&quot; are in [6-8].</div>

<div class='abstract'>A new class of LRS Bianchi type VI0 cosmological models with free gravitational elds and a variable cosmological term is investigated in presence of perfect uid as well as bulk viscous uid. To get the deterministic solution we have imposed the two dierent conditions over the free gravitational elds. In rst case we consider the free gravitational eld as magnetic type whereas in second case `gravitational wrench' of unit `pitch&quot; is supposed to be present in free gravitational eld. The viscosity coecient of bulk viscous uid is assumed to be a power function of mass density. The eect of bulk viscous uid distribution in the universe is compared with perfect uid model. The cosmological constant is found to be a positive decreasing function of time which is corroborated by results from recent observations. The physical and geometric aspects of the models are discussed.</div>

Using the demi-closedness principle for nonexpansive mapping, we prove that the iterative sequence converges strongly to a common element of these three sets under some control conditions. Our results extend recent results announced by many others.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In recent years, there are attempts to describe quantization of planetary distance based on time-independent gravitational Schr&#168;odinger equation, including Rubcic & Rubcic&#8217;s method and also Nottale&#8217;s Scale Relativity method. Nonetheless, there is no solution yet for time-dependent gravitational Schr &#168;odinger equation (TDGSE). In the present paper, a numerical solution of time-dependent gravitational Schrodinger equation is presented, apparently for the first time. This numerical solution leads to gravitational Bohr-radius, as expected. In the subsequent section, we also discuss plausible extension of this gravitational Schr&#168;odinger equation to include the effect of phion condensate via Gross-Pitaevskii equation, as described recently by Moffat. Alternatively one can consider this condensate from the viewpoint of Bogoliubov de Gennes theory, which can be approximated with coupled time-independent gravitational Schr&#168;odinger equation. Further observation is of course recommended in order to refute or verify this proposition.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Using some new characterizations of ideals in BL-algebras, we revisit the paper of A. Borumand, and al.[1] recently published in this Journal. Using the concept of MV-center of a BL-algebra, we give a very simple characterization of Smarandache BL-algebra. We also restate some of the results and provide much simpler proofs. Among other things, we notice that Theorem 3.17 and Theorem 3.18 of [1] are not true and they aect a good portion of the paper. Since Deni- tion 3.19, Examples 3.20, 3.21, Theorem 3.22, Remark 3.23 and Remark 3.24 are based on a wrong Theorem, they are completely irrelevant.</div>

<div class='title'>Pseudo-Manifold Geometries &#184; with Applications</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/linfan_mao">Linfan Mao</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A Smarandache geometry is a geometry which has at least one Smarandachely denied axiom(1969), i.e., an axiom behaves in at least two different ways within the same space, i.e., validated and invalided, or only invalided but in multiple distinct ways and a Smarandache n-manifold is a nmanifold that support a Smarandache geometry. Iseri provided a construction for Smarandache 2-manifolds by equilateral triangular disks on a plane and a more general way for Smarandache 2-manifolds on surfaces, called map geome- tries was presented by the author in [9]&#8722;[10] and [12]. However, few observations for cases of n &#8805; 3 are found on the journals. As a kind of Smarandache geometries, a general way for constructing dimensional n pseudo-manifolds are presented for any integer n &#8805; 2 in this paper. Connection and principal fiber bundles are also defined on these manifolds. Following these constructions, nearly all existent geometries, such as those of Euclid geometry, Lobachevshy- Bolyai geometry, Riemann geometry, Weyl geometry, K&#168;ahler geometry and Finsler geometry, ...,etc., are their sub-geometries.</div>

<div class='title'>On the Universality of Some Smarandache Loops of Bol-Moufang Type</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jaiyeola_temitope_gbolahan">Jaiyeola Temitope Gbolahan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Smarandache quasigroup(loop) is shown to be universal if all its f, g-principal isotopes are Smarandache f, g-principal isotopes. Also, weak Smarandache loops of Bol-Moufang type such as Smarandache: left(right) Bol, Moufang and extra loops are shown to be universal if all their f, g-principal isotopes are Smarandache f, g- principal isotopes. Conversely, it is shown that if these weak Smarandache loops of Bol-Moufang type are universal, then some autotopisms are true in the weak Smaran- dache sub-loops of the weak Smarandache loops of Bol-Moufang type relative to some Smarandache elements. Futhermore, a S in which all its f, g-principal isotopes are Smarandache f, g-principal isotopes is shown to be universal if and only if it is a Smarandache left(right) Bol loop in which all its f, g-principal isotopes are Smarandache f, g-principal isotopes. Also, it is established that a Smarandache inverse property loop in which all its f, g-principal isotopes are Smarandache f, g-principal isotopes is universal if and only if it is a Smarandache Moufang loop in which all its f, g-principal isotopes are Smarandache f, g-principal isotopes. Hence, some of the autotopisms earlier mentioned are found to be true in the Smarandache sub-loops of universal Smarandache: left(right) inverse property loops and inverse property loops.</div>

<div class='title'>A Multi-Space Model for Chinese Bids Evalua&#184;tion with Analyzing</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/linfan_mao">Linfan Mao</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A tendering is a negotiating process for a contract through by a tenderer issuing an invitation, bidders submitting bidding documents and the tenderer accepting a bidding by sending out a notification of award. As a useful way of purchasing, there are many norms and rulers for it in the purchasing guides of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, &#183; &#183; &#183;, also in contract conditions of various consultant associations. In China, there is a law and regulation system for tendering and bidding. However, few works on the mathematical model of a tendering and its evaluation can be found in publication. The main purpose of this paper is to construct a Smarandache multi-space model for a tendering, establish an evaluation system for bidding based on those ideas in the references [7] and [8] and analyze its solution by applying the decision approach for multiple objectives and value engineering. Open problems for pseudo-multi-spaces are also presented in the final section.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/t`emitope_gbolahan_jaiyeola">T`emitope Gbolahan Jaiyeola</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The idea of left(right) palindromic permutations(LPPs,RPPs) and left(right) gen- eralized Smarandache palindromic permutations(LGSPPs,RGSPPs) are introduced in symmetric groups Sn of degree n. It is shown that in Sn, there exist a LPP and a RPP and they are unique(this fact is demonstrated using S2 and S3). The dihedral group Dn is shown to be generated by a RGSPP and a LGSPP(this is observed to be true in S3) but the geometric interpretations of a RGSPP and a LGSPP are found not to be rotation and reflection respectively. In S3, each permutation is at least a RGSPP or a LGSPP. There are 4 RGSPPs and 4 LGSPPs in S3, while 2 permutations are both RGSPPs and LGSPPs. A permutation in Sn is shown to be a LPP or RPP(LGSPP or RGSPP) if and only if its inverse is a LPP or RPP(LGSPP or RGSPP) respectively. Problems for future studies are raised.</div>

<div class='title'>Syntactic - Semantic Axiomatic Theories in Mathematics</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/elemer_e_rosinger">Elemer E Rosinger</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A more careful consideration of the recently introduced &quot;Grossone Theory&quot; of Yaroslav Sergeev, [1], leads to a considerable enlargement of what can constitute possible legitimate mathematical theories by the introduction here of what we may call the {\it Syntactic - Semantic Axiomatic Theories in Mathematics}. The usual theories of mathematics, ever since the ancient times of Euclid, are in fact axiomatic, [1,2], which means that they are {\it syntactic} logical consequences of certain assumed axioms. In these usual mathematical theories {\it semantics} can only play an {\it indirect} role which is restricted to the inspiration and motivation that may lead to the formulation of axioms, definitions, and of the proofs of theorems. In a significant contradistinction to that, and as manifestly inspired and motivated by the mentioned Grossone Theory, here a {\it direct} involvement of {\it semantics} in the construction of axiomatic mathematical theories is presented, an involvement which gives semantics the possibility to act explicitly, effectively, and altogether directly upon the usual syntactic process of constructing the logical consequences of axioms. Two immediate objections to what appears to be an unprecedented and massive expansion of what may now become legitimate mathematical theories given by the {\it syntactic - semantic axiomatic theories} introduced here can be the following : the mentioned direct role of semantics may, willingly or not, introduce in mathematical theories one, or both of the &quot;eternal taboo-s&quot; of {\it inconsistency} and {\it self-reference}. Fortunately however, such concerns can be alleviated due to recent developments in both inconsistent and self-referential mathematics, [1,2]. Grateful recognition is acknowledged here for long and most useful ongoing related disccussions with Yaroslav Sergeev.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/elemer_e_rosinger">Elemer E Rosinger</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Physics depends on &#8221;physical intuition&#8221;, much of which is formulated in terms of Mathematics. Mathematics itself depends on Logic. The paper presents three latest novelties in Logic which have major consequences in Mathematics. Further, it presents two possible significant departures in Mathematics itself. These five departures can have major implications in Physics. Some of them are indicated, among them in Quantum Mechanics and Relativity.</div>
