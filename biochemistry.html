<div class='abstract'>Type 2 diabetes, often referred to as T2D, is a widespread health condition. This study focuses on the specific genetic variation in a single nucleotide poly- morphism (SNP) rs7903146 in the gene TCF7L2 and its potential association with T2D. We examined DNA samples from Bangladeshi individuals to see whether the genetic variant rs7903146 is associated with T2D in this community. We discovered that the CC variant of rs7903146 was extremely prevalent, appearing in all of the samples from people without T2D and in the majority of the samples from people with T2D out of the 38 sequences they looked at (16 from people without T2D and 22 from people with T2D). In a tiny proportion of T2D patients, there was also a less prevalent variant called CT. Surprisingly, the Bangladeshi population in this study did not show a clear association be- tween rs7903146 and T2D. This counters what several earlier investigations have found. This opens the door for more future research to completely comprehend the genetic and environmental causes of T2D to build preventative treatments for this quickly increasing global health problem.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the paper a mathematical method, originated from studies of nonlinear partial differential equations, is applied to the He approximation of outer electron chemical bonds. The results can be used in the study of large molecules like RNA and proteins. We follow a pairwise atom by atom coordinates approximation. Coordinates can be obtained from crystallography or electron microscopy. The present paper solely presents the proof of concept of the existence of an algorithm. It is expected that such algorithm can be employed in studies of larger molecules.</div>

<div class='title'>Algorithmic Simulations of Hydrocortisone-Induced Degeneration</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/philip_naveen">Philip Naveen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Elk River, Gulf Wars, and Atlantic Oxybenzone instances proved chemical contamination is a serious threat. HC is a common corticosteroid used to treat skin lesions that hasn't undergone testing. This research will utilize real plant cultivation, mathematical modeling, machine learning, and custom Python3 programming to determine the effect of HC on plant life. Metadata significant at a 0.01 level under 48 degrees of freedom was gathered by cultivating real Raphanus sativus plants treated with various levels of HC contaminated water; the t-test was verified using Java8 computer code. The simulation comprised of three independent algorithms. Because the metadata was very sparse, the first algorithm was dedicated to using modified bootstrapping to iteratively generate synthetic data points with less entropy. The second algorithm was a deep learning substructure incorporating concepts of linear regression and neural networks; the backpropagation used the MSE loss function and ADAM optimizer, which has aspects of previously engineered AdaGrad and RMSProp models. The third algorithm measured the effect of HC on a terrain based on aquatic content. The simulations used an HC contaminator based of the Gulf Wars event and five semi-aquatic terrains in North America, which were the contaminator and terrestrial parameters respectively. The plant cultivation and software simulations supported the research hypothesis stating that the uncontaminated plants would be healthiest was accepted. Future research could use convolutional neural networks to achieve a higher R-squared value and real-time procedural terrain generation to improve the simulations.</div>

<div class='abstract'>With the advent of IVF technology, the terms normal and abnormal oocytes have been defined and one type of abnormal oocyte is the &#8220;giant oocyte&#8221;. Giant oocytes are defined to have a 30% larger diameter and twice the volume of normal oocytes[1,2]. Giant oocyte is a rarery observed phenomenon among humans and embryos may develop from these oocytes [2,3].The first hypothesis for the mechanism of their formation is cytoplasmic fusion of two oogonia and the second one is the lack of cytokinesis during mitotic divisions in an oogonium [4]. Fertilization and progression of a giant oocyte is suspected to be the cause of digynic triploidy, which is defined as triploidy with two maternal and one paternal complements [5]. In this case report, we present two giant oocytes, each shown to have two meiotic spindles via visualization by polarization microscope. Because giant oocytes can develop into embryos that are morphologically normal, but genetically abnormal, an embryologist has to be aware of this phenomenon. For this reason, the scientific aim of this report is to present the polarization microscopic properties of giant oocytes and increase the awareness of such oocytes among embryologists.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Background: Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality globally. Infants who are born preterm suffer long term health consequences. There only few studies done on risk factors for prematurity in Tanzania. This study aimed to determine the risk factors for preterm birth among women who delivered preterm babies at Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods:A matched case-control study was conducted at the Bugando Medical Centre from May to June 2015. A total of 50 women with preterm birth (cases) were matched with 50 women who had term births (controls). Cases were matched with controls by date of delivery. We excluded mothers with multiple gestations and those who were sick and unsuitable for the interview. A structured questionnaire was used to collected relevant information from all participants. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0. Odds ratios with 95% confidence interval were estimated in a multivariate regression model to determine factors associated with preterm delivery.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jana_parizkova">Jana Pa&#345;&#237;zkov&#225;</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Maternal exercise during pregnancy as one of the critical periods can have significant delayed effect in the offsprring&#8217;s fetal imprinting of future development until adult age; adequate and voluntary exercise is provided, not a forced one as a stress. Spontaneous physical activity of the offspring until adult age can be increased, and body composition, cardiac micro structure and reactibility (greater resistance to noxi), vasomotor function, glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity along with related diseases (diabetes) can be positively influenced. Bone development and also the enhancement of brain function and learning sensitivity can be improved as revealed in a number of experimental model animal studies. Exercise during pregnancy was also shown to compensate in the offspring the detrimental effect of inadequate, e.g. high fat diets. Possibility of introducing significant modifications of the programming of the offspring&#8217;s desirable development and health status by adequate and physiological maternal exercise during pregnancy was supported also by some observations in humans.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Background Accidental bowel leakage, or fecal incontinence, impacts the quality of life in women of all ages. A minimallyinvasive vaginal bowel control system was designed to reduce accidents and provides a new health care option for women. Methods A feasibility study was conducted to evaluate fit, patient comfort, and ease-of-use of this novel vaginal bowel control therapy at home to better inform device design, treatment delivery, and the design of a subsequent pivotal clinical trial protocol. Staged evaluations were performed in women without and with self-reported accidental bowel leakage of any severity. Wear duration progressed from an initial one-time, in-office fitting to extended-wear periods at home. Device-related adverse events were collected in all subjects exposed to the device. Treatment responses were collected at baseline and after 1-month wear in women with accidental bowel leakage. Additionally, device comfort and satisfaction were assessed.

Physical examination showed two soft perineal masses located between a bifid scrotum and the anus. No abnormalities of anus were detected. The patient underwent ultrasound and magnetic resonance examinations confirming a homogeneous fat tissue matter of the posterior mass and showing fluid content inside the anterior one. The patient also underwent a Gastrografin enema and no analcolon anomalies were detected. The masses were completely excised and the histological examination revealed a lipoma, with tissue suggestive of scrotum, so a definite diagnosis of accessory scrotum, associated with lipoma was made.

<div class='abstract'>Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, largely due to its propensity for recurrence and metastasis, even after removal of malignant tissue. When melanoma reaches advanced stages, the disease becomes refractory to many types of therapy, which has created a need for novel therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. Our group focuses on the oncogenic function of a neuronal receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1). When mGluR1 is aberrantly expressed in melanocytes, elevated levels of extracellular glutamate mediate the constitutive activation of the receptor to promote cell proliferation. We are exploring the potential synergistic efficacy when combining a glutamatergic signaling inhibitor with a checkpoint inhibitor antibody</div>
