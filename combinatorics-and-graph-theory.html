<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/peng_ji">Peng Ji</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Formal Calculation uses an auxiliary form to calculate various nested sums and provides results in three forms. In addition to computation, it is also a powerful tool for analysis, allowing one to study various numbers in a unified way. This article contains many results of two types of Stirling numbers, associated Stirling numbers, and Eulerian numbers, making a great generalization of Euler polynomials, Wilson's theorem, and Wolstenholme's theorem, showing that they are just special cases. Formal Calculation provides a novel method for obtaining combinatorial identities and analyzing q-binomial.This article has obtained many results in q-analogues, including inversion formulas for q-binomial coefficients. This article also introduces a theorem on symmetry</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_j_mathar">Richard J. Mathar</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Chord diagrams are cubic graphs with two types of edges: the first set of edges comprise a subgraph which is a simple cycle (the frame); the second type of edges (the chords) comprise disconnected 2-vertex subgraphs incident to distinct vertices of the frame. We define associated cubic graphs with directed chords (arcs) while keeping the edges of the frame undirected, and plot all 1, 3, 13, and 121 of them for 2, 4, 6, and 8 vertices.</div>

<div class='title'>Graph Isomorphism in Polynomial time</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/christos_i_karatzas">Christos I. Karatzas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We show that the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem can be solved in polynomialO(n3 + n2 m log(n + m) + m2 n log(n + m) + m3 log(n + m)) time, on simple con-nected graphs with n vertices and m edges. As fundamental part of the proof,we introduce a novel method, named Symmetry Classication, which computesa canonical automorphism partition of a simple connected graph in polynomialO(n2 + nm log n) time. The master algorithm reduces to bipartite graph iso-morphism by transforming the input graph, if not bipartite, to its subdivisiongraph and computes the canonical form of the latter; or of the former if alreadybipartite. Canonical form is obtained by repeating the sequence of rst applyingSymmetry Classication method, then canonically selecting a vertex for indi-vidualization, and last applying the classical 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehmanalgorithm, until a canonical discrete coloring is attained. Since both bipartiteand connected graph isomorphism are isomorphism complete we conclude thatGI lies in P.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/teo_banica">Teo Banica</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This is an introduction to graph theory, from a geometric viewpoint. A finite graph $X$ is described by its adjacency matrix $din M_N(0,1)$, which can be thought of as a kind of discrete Laplacian, and we first discuss the basics of graph theory, by using $d$ and linear algebra tools. Then we discuss the computation of the classical and quantum symmetry groups $G(X)subset G^+(X)$, which must leave invariant the eigenspaces of $d$. Finally, we discuss similar questions for the quantum graphs, with these being again described by certain matrices $din M_N(mathbb C)$, but in a more twisted way.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/yasunori_ohto">Yasunori Ohto</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The problem of determining whether a graph has a fixed-point-free automorphism is NP-complete. We demonstrate that the problem can be solved efficiently within polynomial time. First, we obtain the automorphisms of an input graph G by using a spectral method. Next, we prove the Theorem used to detect whether there is a fixed-point free automorphism in G. Next, we construct an algorithm to detect whether G has a fixed-point-free automorphism using this result. The computational complexity of detecting whether a graph has a fixed-point-free automorphism is O(n^5). If fixed-point-free automorphism exist, the computational complexity of obtaining a fixed-point-free automorphism is O(n^6). Then, the complexity classes P and NP are the same.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/parker_emmerson">Parker Emmerson</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we have explained how logic-vectors can be interpreted as a geometrical representation over computational engines and how it can be implemented in code using large language models. We have also proposed the usage of Time Compass to derive logic-vector evolution over a quasi-chaotic system and its direct manipulation on the tessellation Colormap.&#160;This paper focuses on the optimal arrangement of reflecting points for efficient ray tracing given limited sweep time. We examine spatial configurations, employing our core concept of a sweeping subnet and defining a causal barrier to capture constraints imposed by time.We will also discuss the influence of these constructions on the design of an algorithm for approximating optimal tessellations.I have provided code for each of the graphs, as the mathematics is demonstrated unequivocally by their implementation. The reader can test out the reality of this system by visualizing the graphs themselves using Python in a suitable environment like Google Colaboratory.</div>

<div class='title'>The Isomorphism of H4 and E8</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/j_gregory_moxness">J. Gregory Moxness</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper gives an explicit isomorphic mapping from the 240 real R^8 roots of the E8 Gossett 4_{21} 8-polytope to two golden ratio scaled copies of the 120 root H4 600-cell quaternion 4-polytope using a traceless 8x8 rotation matrix U with palindromic characteristic coefficients and a unitary form e^{iU}}. It also shows the inverse map from a single H4 600-cell to E8 using a 4D&lt;-&gt;8D chiral L&lt;-&gt;R mapping function, phi scaling, and U^{-1}. This approach shows that there are actually four copies of each 600-cell living within E8 in the form of chiral H4L+phi H4L+H4R+phi H4R roots. In addition, it demonstrates a quaternion Weyl orbit construction of H4-based 4-polytopes that provides an explicit mapping between E8 and four copies of the tri-rectified Coxeter-Dynkin diagram of H4, namely the 120-cell of order 600. Taking advantage of this property promises to open the door to as yet unexplored E8-based Grand Unified Theories or GUTs.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/felipe_correa_rodriguez">Felipe Correa Rodr&#237;guez</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Harmonic Graphs Conjecture states that there exists an asymptotic relation involving the Harmonic Index and the natural logarithm as the order of the graph increases. This conjecture, grounded in the novel context of Prime Graphs, draws upon the Prime Number Theorem and the sum of divisors function to unveil a compelling asymptotic connection. By carefully expanding the definitions of the harmonic index and the sum of divisors function, and leveraging the prime number theorem's approximations, we establish a formula that captures this intricate relationship. This work is an effort to contribute to the advancement of graph theory, introducing a fresh lens through which graph connectivity can be explored. The synthesis of prime numbers and graph properties not only deepens our understanding of structural complexity but also paves the way for innovative research directions.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/g_i_kalmykov">G. I. Kalmykov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The article deals with labeled rooted growing trees. Research in this area, carried outby the author of this article over the past 35 years, has led to the creation of the conceptof tree classification of labeled graphs. This concept is the mathematical basis of the treesum method aimed at simplifying the representations of the coefficients of power series in classical statistical mechanics. This method was used to obtain tree representations of Mayer coefficients of expansions of pressure and density in terms of activity degrees, which are free from asymptotic catastrophe. The same method was used to obtain tree representations of thecoefficients of the expansion of the ratio of activity to density in terms of activity degrees.All these representations for n &#8805; 7 are much simpler than the comparable Ree-Hooverrepresentations according to the complexity criteria defined on these representations. Treerepresentations of the coefficients of the expansion of the m-particles distribution functioninto a series in terms of activity degrees were also obtained. All the above representations ofthe coefficients of power series obtained by the trees sum method are free from the asymptoticcatastrophe.In order to provide a mathematical basis for constructing new, even less complexrepresentations of the coefficients of these power series, further development of the conceptof tree classification of labeled graphs was required.As part of solving the problem of further development of this concept, the article proposesnew classifications of labeled rooted growing trees. And on their basis, the theorem wasformulated and proved, which is the basis for simplifying the tree representations of functions,that is, its representations as a sum of labeled by trees products of functions.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Bridge graphs are special type of graphs which are constructed by connecting identical connected graphs with path graphs. We discuss different type of bridge graphs $B_{n\times l}^{m\times k}$ in this paper. In particular, we discuss the following: complete-type bridge graphs, star-type bridge graphs, and full binary tree bridge graphs. We also bound the second eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian of these graphs using methods from Spectral Graph Theory. In general, we prove that for general bridge graphs, $B_{n\times l}^2$, the second eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian should between $0$ and $2$, inclusive. At the end, we talk about the future work about infinite bridge graphs. We create definitions and found the related theorems to support our future work about infinite bridge graphs.</div>

<div class='title'>Graph Thinness, a Lower Bound and Complexity</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/yaroslav_shitov">Yaroslav Shitov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The thinness of a simple graph G= (V,E) is the smallest integer k for which there exist a total order (V, &lt;) and a partition of V into k classes (V_1,...,V_k) such that, for all u, v, w in V with u&lt;v&lt;w, if u and v belong to the same class and {u,w} is in E, then {v,w} is in E. We prove that (1) there are $n$-vertex graphs of thinness $n-o(n)$, which answers a question of Bonomo-Braberman, Gonzalez, Oliveira, Sampaio, and Szwarcfiter, (2) the computation of thinness is NP-hard, which is a solution to a long standing open problem posed by Mannino and Oriolo.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/steven_m_tylock">Steven M. Tylock</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Collatz Conjecture remains an intriguing problem. Expanding on an altered formula first presented in &#8220;Bits of Complexity&#8221;, this paper explores the concept that &#8220;3N + Least-Significant-Bit&#8221; of a number allows the complete separation of the step of &#8220;dividing by two on an even number&#8221; within the Collatz Conjecture. This alternate formula replaces the original Collatz on a one-for-one basis. The breadth and depth of graphs of the resulting path of numbers resolving with this new formula illustrate its fractal nature. Lastly, we explore the predictability of this data, and how the ultimate goal of reaching one prevented previous work from finding the key to understanding 3N+1.</div>

<div class='title'>Quantum Partial Automorphisms of Finite Graphs</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/teo_banica">Teo Banica</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The partial automorphisms of a graph $X$ having $N$ vertices are the bijections $\sigma:I\to J$ with $I,J\subset\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which leave invariant the edges. These bijections form a semigroup $\widetilde{G}(X)$, which contains the automorphism group $G(X)$. We discuss here the quantum analogue of this construction, with a definition and basic theory for the quantum semigroup of quantum partial automorphisms $\widetilde{G}^+(X)$, which contains both $G(X)$, and the quantum automorphism group $G^+(X)$. We comment as well on the case $N=\infty$, which is of particular interest, due to the fact that $\widetilde{G}^+(X)$ is well-defined, while its subgroup $G^+(X)$, not necessarily, at least with the currently known methods.</div>

<div class='title'>Embedding Cycles Within Adjacency Matrices to Represent Rational Generating Functions</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/yonah_berwaldt">Yonah Berwaldt</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper explores populating adjacency matrices with connected cycles whose final outputs represent the coefficients of rational generating functions (RGFs). An RGF takes the form of: $p(x)/q(x) + r(x)$. The denominator, $q(x)$, takes the form of: Constant $\cdot (1-c_1x^{x_1})(1-c_2x^{x_2})... (1-c_nx^{x_n})$ where the $c_i$ are complex numbers and where factors can possibly have multiplicities greater than one. It is well known that a closed form solution exists for computing coefficients of RGFs. Also, one can write the linear recurrence relation associated with every RGF into a matrix format. Using matrices, one can compute coefficients for an RGF, such as Molien series for finite groups, in logarithmic time. What has not yet been shown (or is not yet commonly discussed) is that one can conceptualize an RGF as a system of connected cycles within an overarching adjacency matrix. For example, a single cycle of length two would have vertex A connect to vertex B which itself connects back to vertex A with a directed arrow of weight $c_i$. In this conceptualization, each coefficient of an RGF can be reproduced by taking a suitable adjacency matrix to an integer power. Nothing essential is lost by taking this perspective. Due to the self-similar nature of the matrix, we devise an algorithm that can calculate coefficients of RGFs in constant time. Using memoization, a technique for caching intermediate results, calculating coefficients of RGFs can also be done in logarithmic time. One observation is that, depending on the situation (i.e. what $q(x)$ is), there may be a computational benefit to taking the cyclical perspective. For example, for certain $q(x)$, the traditional matrix has cells containing positive and negative values whereas the cyclical approach has cells containing only positive values. The computational benefit is probably irrelevant for computers; however, it may be important for restrictive systems, such as biological systems / neural networks that may have a tight operating envelope. We make a final observation that each cyclical matrix representation can be thought of as a graph which is an epsilon away from being strongly connected. Studying the behavior of these matrices may yield insight into the behavior of a broader class of function. In essence, the study of sequences modeled by RGFs can be converted to the study of connected cyclical graphs that model the RGFs or vice versa.</div>

<div class='title'>Chordal Bipartite Graphs Are Rank Determined</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/yaroslav_shitov">Yaroslav Shitov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A partial matrix A is a rectangular array with entries in F &#8746; {&#8727;}, where F is the ground field, and &#8727; is a placeholder symbol for entries which are not specified. The minimum rank mr(A) is the smallest value of the ranks of all matrices obtained from A by replacing the &#8727; symbols with arbitrary elements in F. For any bipartite graph G with vertices (U, V), one defines the set M(G) of partial matrices in which the row indexes are in U, the column indexes are in V, and the (u, v) entry is specified if and only if u, v are adjacent in G. We prove that, if G is chordal bipartite, then the minimum rank of any matrix in M(G) is determined by the ranks of its fully specified submatrices. This result was conjectured by Cohen, Johnson, Rodman, Woerdeman in 1989.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This paper deals with nite (possibly not complete) unambiguous automata, not necessarily deterministic. In this setting, we investigate the problem of the minimal length of the uncompletable word. This problem is associated with the well-known conjecture formulated by A. Restivo. We introduce the concept of relatively maximal row for a suitable set of matrices, and show the existence of a relatively maximal row of length of quadratic order with respect to the number of the states of the treated automaton. We give some estimates of the maximal length of the minimal uncompletable word in connection with the number the states of the involved automaton and the length of a suitable relatively maximal but not maximal word, provided that it exists. In the general case, we establish an estimate of the length of the minimal uncompletable word in terms of the number of states of the studied automaton, the length of a suitable relatively maximal word and the minimal length of the uncompletable word of the automaton formed by all associated maximal rows.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Let $G$ be a graph containing no component isomorphic to the path graph of order $2$. Denote by $d_w$ the degree of a vertex $w$ in $G$. The augmented Zagreb index ($AZI$) of $G$ is the sum of the quantities $(d_ud_v/(d_u+d_v-2))^3$ over all edges $uv$ of $G$. Denote by $\mathcal{G}(n,\chi)$ the class of all connected graphs of a fixed order $n$ and with a fixed chromatic number $\chi$, where $n\ge5$ and $3\le \chi \le n-1$. The problem of finding graph(s) attaining the maximum $AZI$ in the class $\mathcal{G}(n,\chi)$ has been solved recently in [F. Li, Q. Ye, H. Broersma, R. Ye, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 85 (2021) 257--274] for the case when $n$ is a multiple of $\chi$.

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_j_mathar">Richard J. Mathar</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This work provides a Java program which constructs free polyominoes of size n sorted by width and height of the convex hull (i.e., its rectangular bounding box). The results correct counts for 15-ominoes published in the 1967 proceedings of the SIAM Fall Meeting, and extend them to 17-ominoes and partially to even larger polyominoes. [vixra:1905.0474]</div>

<div class='title'>Introducing: Second-Order Permutation</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/bassey_godwin_bassey">Bassey Godwin Bassey</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this study we answer questions that have to do with finding out the total number of ways of arranging a finite set of symbols or objects directly under a single line constraint set of finite symbols such that common symbols between the two sets do not repeat on the vertical positions. We go further to study the outcomes when both sets consist of the same symbols and when they consist of different symbols. We identify this form of permutation as 'second-order permutation' and show that it has a corresponding unique factorial which plays a prominent role in most of the results obtained. This has been discovered by examining many practical problems which give rise to the emergence of second-order permutation. Upon examination of these problems, it becomes clear that a directly higher order of permutation exist. Hence this study aims at equipping mathematics scholars, educators and researchers with the necessary background knowledge and framework for incorporating second-order permutation into the field of combinatorial mathematics.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Previously, a determination of the relationship between the Natural numbers (N) and the n'th odd fibbinary number has been made using a relationship with the Golden ratio \phi=(Sqrt[5]+1}/2 and \tau=1/\phi. Specifically, if the n'th odd fibbinary equates to the j'th N, then j=Floor[n(\phi+1) - 1]. This note documents the completion of the relationship for the even fibbinary numbers, such that if the n'th even fibbinary equates to the j'th N, then j=Floor[n(\tau+1) + \tau].</div>

<div class='title'>Exact Map Inference in General Higher-Order Graphical Models Using Linear Programming</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ikhlef_bechar">Ikhlef Bechar</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper is concerned with the problem of exact MAP inference in general higher-order graphical models by means of a traditional linear programming relaxation approach. In fact, the proof that we have developed in this paper is a rather simple algebraic proof being made straightforward, above all, by the introduction of two novel algebraic tools. Indeed, on the one hand, we introduce the notion of delta-distribution which merely stands for the difference of two arbitrary probability distributions, and which mainly serves to alleviate the sign constraint inherent to a traditional probability distribution. On the other hand, we develop an approximation framework of general discrete functions by means of an orthogonal projection expressing in terms of linear combinations of function margins with respect to a given collection of point subsets, though, we rather exploit the latter approach for the purpose of modeling locally consistent sets of discrete functions from a global perspective. After that, as a first step, we develop from scratch the expectation optimization framework which is nothing else than a reformulation, on stochastic grounds, of the convex-hull approach, as a second step, we develop the traditional LP relaxation of such an expectation optimization approach, and we show that it enables to solve the MAP inference problem in graphical models under rather general assumptions. Last but not least, we describe an algorithm which allows to compute an exact MAP solution from a perhaps fractional optimal (probability) solution of the proposed LP relaxation.</div>

<div class='title'>A Class of Multinomial Permutations Avoiding Object Clusters</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/richard_j_mathar">Richard J. Mathar</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The multinomial coefficients count the number of ways (of permutations) of placing a number of partially distinguishable objects on a line, taking ordering into account. A well-known two-parametric family of counts arises if there are objects of c distinguishable colors and m objects of each color, m*c objects in total, to be placed on line. In this work we propose an algorithm to count the permutations where no two objects of the same color appear side-by-side on the line. This eliminates all permutations with &quot;clusters&quot; of colors. Essentially we represent filling the line sequentially with objects as a tree of states where each node matches one partially filled line. Subtrees are merged if they have the same branching structure, and weights are assigned to nodes in the tree keeping track of how many mergers take place. This is implemented in a JAVA program; numerical results confirm Hardin's earlier counts for this kind of restricted permutations.</div>

Each step requires to pour one jug into another without spilling until either the source jug is empty or the drain jug is full-because the model assumes the jugs have irregular shape and no further marks. The program simply places the initial jug configuration at the root of the tree of state diagrams and deploys the branches (avoiding loops) recursively by generating all possible states from known states in one pouring step.</div>

The problem is also solvable in linear time when one cograph is given as an induced subgraph of the other. We characterize absolute retracts for the class of cographs. Foldings generalize retractions. We show that the problem to fold a trivially perfect graph onto a largest possible clique is NP-complete.

We show that knot's normalization doesn't affect combinatorial map what concerns its generality. Knot's normalization leads to more concise numeration of corners in maps, e.g., odd or even corners allow easy to follow distinguished cycles in map caused by the fixation of the knot. Knot's normalization may be applied to edge structuring knot too. If both are normalized then one is fully and other partially normalized mutually.</div>
