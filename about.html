    <h1>About viXra One</h1>
    <h3>What is this website?</h3>viXra One is an index of
    viXra papers satisfying basic arXiv requirements.
    It was created with the goal of combining the quality of arXiv papers
    with the openness of submission of viXra.
    <h3>Is this a repository? How can I submit?</h3>This is an
    index and not a repository. Papers are extracted from viXra, so
    that is where you should submit your paper if you want it to be shown here.
    <h3>What is wrong with arXiv?</h3>We believe that arXiv is one
    of the greatest initiatives in the history of science. But its
    endorsement system introduced in 2004 can make it prohibitively
    hard for authors to submit papers outside their own field, and
    for non-professional authors to submit altogether. Moreover,
    papers are subject to moderation, which is carried out by
    overworked humans and without any transparent set of criteria,
    and which may lead to the rejection of good papers for
    arbitrary reasons.
    <h3>What is wrong with viXra?</h3>viXra emerged in 2009 as a
    completely open alternative to the arXiv, where anyone is free
    to submit without any endorsement or moderation. This way, the
    chance of a good paper being lost is, by construction, zero. We
    believe that this is a great concept and that viXra serves a
    very valuable function. But it turns out that the site is
    unbrowseable: the majority of papers (&gt;80%) are Word
    documents without references which are very far from being of
    publication quality. This way, good papers submitted to the
    repository end up buried in a pile of bad material, making it
    hard for them to be discovered.
    <h3>What criteria are used for selecting the papers?</h3>
    The current criteria are the following:
    <ul>
      <li>The paper must be typeset using TeX.</li>
      <li>The paper must contain references (preferably at least 2).</li>
      <li>The description of the paper on viXra must contain at least 25 words.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My viXra paper is not shown here. What can I do?</h3>
    If you submit a replacement of your paper to viXra with the requirements
    above satisfied, it will be processed again and shown here in the next update
    of the index.

    <h3>Who made this?</h3>This website was created by <a href="https://ruggiero.github.io/">Rafael Ruggiero</a>, an
    astrophysicist and enthusiast of the open science concept.
