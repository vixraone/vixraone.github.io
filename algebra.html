<div class='title'>Geometric Entity Dualization in the Geometric Algebra PGA G(3,0,1)</div>

<div class='abstract'>In Geometric Algebra, the degenerate-metric algebra G(3,0,1) is known as the Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) for 3D space (3DPGA). In PGA, there is a point-based geometric algebra (point-based PGA) and a plane-based geometric algebra (plane-based PGA). Both algebras have homogeneous geometric entities for points, lines, and planes. The two algebras of PGA are dual to each other through a new geometric entity dualization operation J_e, which is introduced in this paper as its main subject and contribution. The new dualization J_e is an anti-involution with inverse &#8722;J_e = D_e. Using J_e, the dual of a point-based PGA entity is its corresponding plane-based PGA entity representing the same geometry (point, line, or plane) with the same orientation. Using D_e = &#8722;J_e, the inverse dual (undual) of a plane-based PGA entity is its corresponding point-based PGA entity with the same orientation. The new dualization operation Je maintains the correct orientation of an entity. J_e is defined by a table of duals that are found empirically by observation to maintain correct entity orientation through the dualization. We define a Hodge star dualization operation to be purely an involution, or else purely an anti-involution, between all basis blades and their dual basis blades. As an anti-involution, J_e is also implemented by algebraic methods using Hodge star dualizations in non-degenerate algebras that correspond to PGA. In the prior literature, there are other definitions for the duals in PGA that may not maintain the correct entity orientation and are different than J_e.</div>

<div class='title'>Dual Quaternion Geometric Algebra in PGA G(3,0,1)</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_benjamin_easter">Robert Benjamin Easter</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/daranee_pimchangthong">Daranee Pimchangthong</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In Geometric Algebra, the algebra G(3,0,1) is known as PGA, the plane-based and point-based geometric algebras, or projective geometric algebra, of points, lines, and planes in 3D space. The even-grades subalgebra of PGA, which we call Dual Quaternion Geometric Algebra (DQGA), represents Dual Quaternion Algebra (DQA). In the plane-based algebra of PGA, there are entities for points, lines, and planes and many operations on them, including dualization to the point-based entities, reflections in planes, rotations, translations, projections, rejections, and intersections (meet products). In this paper, we derive a complete set of identities that relate all of the plane-based entities and operations in PGA to their corresponding entities and operations in DQGA. Therefore, this paper contributes into the literature on dual quaternions and PGA the complete details on how to use DQA or DQGA as a geometric algebra of points, lines, and planes with many useful operations. All DQGA entities and operations are defined or derived such that the orientations of the entities are maintained correctly through all of the operations. We also define three new part operators for taking the point, line, or plane part of a dual quaternion, which may improve the computational efficiency of intersection (meet) operations. Dual quaternions already have some applications in computer graphics and kinematics. This paper expands on the understanding of dual quaternions and introduces DQA as a versatile geometric algebra of points, lines, and planes with many new operations that do not appear in prior literature, expanding the possible applications of dual quaternions.</div>

Then we get into the study of the closed groups of unitary matrices $Gsubset U_N$, with some basic algebraic theory, and with a number of probability computations, in the finite group case. In the general case, where $Gsubset U_N$ is compact, we explain how the Weingarten integration formula works, and we present some basic $Ntoinfty$ applications.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In Geometric Algebra, G(1,3,1) is a degenerate-metric geometric algebra being introduced in this paper as Space Time PGA [STPGA], based on 3D Homogeneous PGA G(3,0,1) [3DPGA] and 4D Conformal Spacetime CGA G(2,4,0) [CSTA]. In CSTA, there are flat (linear) geometric entities for hyperplane, plane, line, and point as inner product null space (IPNS) geometric entities and dual outer product null space (OPNS) geometric entities. The IPNS CSTA geometric entities are closely related, in form, to the STPGA plane-based geometric entities. Many other aspects of STPGA are borrowed and adapted from 3DPGA, including a new geometric entity dualization operation J_e that is an involution in STPGA. STPGA includes operations for spatial rotation, spacetime hyperbolic rotation (boost), and spacetime translation as versor operators. This short paper only introduces the basics of the STPGA algebra. Further details and applications may appear in a later extended paper or in other papers. This paper is intended as a quick and practical introduction to get started, including explicit forms for all entities and operations. Longer papers are cited for further details.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In Geometric Algebra, G(3,0,1) is a degenerate-metric algebra known as PGA, originally called Projective Geometric Algebra in prior literature. It includes within it a point-based algebra, plane-based algebra, and a dual quaternion geometric algebra (DQGA). In the point-based algebra of PGA, there are outer product null space (OPNS) geometric entities based on a 1-blade point entity, and the join (outer product) of two or three points forms a 2-blade line or 3-blade plane. In the plane-based algebra of PGA, there are commutator product null space (CPNS) geometric entities based on a 1-blade plane entity, and the meet (outer product) of two or three planes forms a 2-blade line or 3-blade point. The point-based OPNS entities are dual to the plane-based CPNS entities through a new geometric entity dualization operation J_e that is defined by careful observation of the entity duals in same orientation and collected in a table of basis-blade duals. The paper contributes the new operation J_e and its implementations using three different nondegenerate algebras {G(4),G(3,1),G(1,3)} as forms of Hodge star dualizations, which in geometric algebra are various products of entities with nondegenerate unit pseudoscalars, taking a grade k entity to its dual grade 4-k entity copied back into G(3,0,1). The paper contributes a detailed development of DQGA. DQGA represents and emulates the dual quaternion algebra (DQA) as a geometric algebra that is entirely within the even-grades subalgebra of PGA G(3,0,1). DQGA has a close relation to the plane-based CPNS PGA entities through identities, which allows to derive dual quaternion representations of points, lines, planes, and many operations on them (reflection, rotation, translation, intersection, projection), all within the dual quaternion algebra. In DQGA, all dual quaternion operations are implemented by using the larger PGA algebra. The DQGA standard operations include complex conjugate, quaternion conjugate, dual conjugate, and part operators (scalar, vector, tensor, unit, real, imaginary), and some new operations are defined for taking more parts (point, plane, line) and taking the real component of the imaginary part by using the new operation J_e. All DQGA entities and operations are derived in detail. It is possible to easily convert any point-based OPNS PGA entity to and from its dual plane-based CPNS PGA entity, and then also convert any CPNS PGA entity to and from its DQGA entity form, all without changing orientation of the entities. Thus, each of the three algebras within PGA can be taken advantage of for what it does best, made possible by the operation J_e and identities relating CPNS PGA to DQGA. PGA G(3,0,1) is then doubled into a Double PGA (DPGA) G(6,0,2) including a Double DQGA (DDQGA), which feature two closely related forms of a general quadric entity that can be rotated, translated, and intersected with planes and lines. The paper then concludes with final remarks.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/dimiter_prodanov">Dimiter Prodanov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Clifford algebras are an active area of mathematical research with numerous applications in mathematical physics and computer graphics among many others.The paper demonstrates an algorithm for the computation of inverses of such numbers in a non-degenerate Clifford algebra of an arbitrary dimension. This is achieved by the translation of the classical Faddeev-LeVerrier-Souriau (FVS) algorithm for characteristic polynomial computation in the language of the Clifford algebra. The FVS algorithm is implemented using the Clifford package in the open-source Computer Algebra System Maxima.Symbolic and numerical examples in different Clifford algebras are presented.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/chengshen_xu">Chengshen Xu</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A real matrix may not be similar to a diagonal matrix or a Jordan canonical matrix in the real number field. However, it is valuable to discuss the quasi-diagonalization and quasi-Jordanization of matrices in the field of real numbers. Because the characteristic polynomial of a real matrix is a real coefficient polynomial, the complex eigenvalues and eigenvector chains occur in complex conjugate pairs. So we can re-select the base vectors to quasi-diagonalize it or quasi-Jordanize it into blocks whose dimensions are no larger than 2. In this paper, we prove these conclusions and give the method of finding transition matrix from the Jordan canonical form matrix to the quasi-diagonalized matrix.</div>

This foundation is built on a direct-sum parametric type system for tangent bundles, vector spaces, and also projective and differential geometry. Geometric algebra is a mathematical foundation for differential geometry, which can be used to simplify the Maxwell equations to a single wave equation due to the geometric product. Introduction of geometric algebra to engineering science disciplines will be easier with programmable foundations.In order to devise an expressive and performance oriented language for efficient discrete differential geometric algebra with the Grassmann elements, an efficient computer algebra representation was programmed. With this unifying mathematical foundation, it is possible to improve efficiency of multi-disciplinary research using geometric tensor calculus by relying on universal mathematical principles. Tools built on universal differential geometric algebra provide a natural geometric language for the Helmholtz decomposition and Hodge-DeRahm co/homology.</div>

This preparatory article consists essentially in a review of the topics involved, and the ``maize'' of relationships to be clarified subsequently. Examples are provided and further directions of investigation are suggested. It is, if successful, a viable, possibly new approach to proving the Riemann Hypothesis, with hindsight from the proof in finite characteristic and function fields.</div>

<div class='title'>On Galois Theory with an Invitation to Category Theory</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/lucian_m_ionescu">Lucian M Ionescu</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Galois theory in the category of cyclic groups studies the automorphism groups of the cyclic group extensions and the corresponding Galois connection. The theory can be rephrased in dual terms of quotients, corresponding to extensions, when viewed as covering maps. The computation of Galois groups and stating the associated Galois connection are based on already existing work regarding the automorphism groups of finite p-adic groups. The initial goals for developing such a theory were: pedagogical, to introduce the basic language of Category Theory, while exposing the student to core ideas of Galois Theory, but also targeting applications to the Galois Theory of cyclotomic extensions. Some aspects of Abelian Class Field Theory and Anabelian Geometry are also mentioned.</div>

<div class='title'>Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (Using 6 Methods)</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mantzakouras_nikos">Mantzakouras Nikos</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Pythagorean theorem is perhaps the best known theorem in the vast world of mathematics.A simple relation of square numbers, which encapsulates all the glory of mathematical science, isalso justifiably the most popular yet sublime theorem in mathematical science. The starting pointwas Diophantus&#8217; 20 th problem (Book VI of Diophantus&#8217; Arithmetica), which for Fermat is for n= 4 and consists in the question whether there are right triangles whose sides can be measuredas integers and whose surface can be square. This problem was solved negatively by Fermat inthe 17 th century, who used the wonderful method (ipse dixit Fermat) of infinite descent. Thedifficulty of solving Fermat&#8217;s equation was first circumvented by Willes and R. Taylor in late1994 ([1],[2],[3],[4]) and published in Taylor and Willes (1995) and Willes (1995). We presentthe proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem and other accompanying theorems in 4 different independentways. For each of the methods we consider, we use the Pythagorean theorem as a basic principleand also the fact that the proof of the first degree Pythagorean triad is absolutely elementary anduseful. The proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem marks the end of a mathematical era; however, theurgent need for a more educational proof seems to be necessary for undergraduates and students ingeneral. Euler&#8217;s method and Willes&#8217; proof is still a method that does not exclude other equivalentmethods. The principle, of course, is the Pythagorean theorem and the Pythagorean triads, whichform the basis of all proofs and are also the main way of proving the Pythagorean theorem in anunderstandable way. Other forms of proofs we will do will show the dependence of the variableson each other. For a proof of Fermat&#8217;s theorem without the dependence of the variables cannotbe correct and will therefore give undefined and inconclusive results . It is, therefore, possible to prove Fermat's last theorem more simply and equivalently than the equation itself, without monomorphisms. &quot;If one cannot explain something simply so that the last student can understand it, it is not called an intelligible proof and of course he has not understood it himself.&quot; R.Feynman Nobel Prize in Physics .1965.</div>

<div class='title'>Proof of Beal's Conjecture</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/nikos_mantzakouras">Nikos Mantzakouras</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The difference between the Beal equation and the Fermat equation is the different exponents of the variables and the method of solving it. As we will show, for the proof of the Beal equation to be complete, Fermat's theorem will be must hold. There are only 10 known solutions and all of them appear with exponent 2. This very fact is proved here using a uniform method. Therefore, Beal's conjecture is true under the above conditions because it accepts that there is no solution if the condition that all exponent values are greater than 2 occurs, the truth of which is proved in Theorem 6, based on the results of Theorem 5. The primary purpose for solving the equation is to see what happens for solving the equation ax + by = cz i.e. for Pythagorean triples of degree 1. This is the generator of the theorems and programs that follow.</div>

<div class='title'>Extending Lasenby&#8217;s Embedding of Octonions in Space-Time Algebra Cl(1,3), to All Three and Four Dimensional Clifford Geometric Algebras Cl(p,q), N = P + Q = 3,4</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eckhard_hitzer">Eckhard Hitzer</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We study the embedding of octonions in the Clifford geometric algebra for spacetime STA Cl(1,3), as suggested by Anthony Lasenby at AGACSE 2021. As far as possible, we extend the approach to similar octonion embeddings for all three- and four dimensional Clifford geometric algebras Cl(p,q), n = p + q = 3,4. Noticeably, the lack of a quaternionic subalgebra in Cl(2,1), seems to prevent the construction of an octonion embedding in this case, and necessitates a special approach in Cl(2,2). As examples, we present for Cl(3,0) the non-associativity of the octonionic product in terms of multivector grade parts with cyclic symmetry, show how octonion products and involutions can be combined to make the opposite transition from octonions to the Clifford geometric algebra Cl(3,0), and how octonionic multiplication can be represented with (complex) biquaternions or Pauli matrix algebra.</div>

<div class='title'>Higher Multiplicative Series</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/vishal_pandey">Vishal Pandey</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In the Fibonacci series, we have two numbers by adding them we get a series consisting of even and odd numbers in this it goes up to infinity we can track any n the number by Binet&#8217;s formula. I have just thought of the multiplication of the first two terms and continued till where I can go, it means that the first two terms in the form (a, b) we will continue the multiplication as we do the addition in the Fibonacci series. As a result, we will get the big integers from the 7th term approximately which is obvious by multiplying to its previous one it will come to a very big integer which cannot be accountable by some range. If we do the multiplication the first two terms will be the same however from the third term it can be written as the power of those integers in which the powers will be following the Fibonacci series in this we can also find the nth term for the multiplicative series. Here the first two terms will be in the same order as they will be given to find the series by changing the order it will violate the rule of the restricted term. The meaning of the restricted here is that the order of (a, b) will be the same throughout the calculation of the whole series we cannot alter that if we do so then it will not be a more restricted term. So there are two concepts in the multiplicative series restricted and non-restricted series. If the (a, b) is there and the operation is going on then it can be said as the restricted series if it is given (a, b) and asked for the (b, a) series then it is said as non-restricted series. I have considered 4 possible criteria to check the pairing of the variables (a, b). We will get to know about the series and also the nth term value of that series for all possible solutions.</div>

The properties of complex vectors similar to the parallelism and orthogonality of ordinary real vectors are investigated. Vector structures that are cyclic with respect to the product are found, and a theorem on the identity of a vector cycle and an oriented basis is proved. As we have found out, the bases of the complex vector space, as in the real case, split into two orientations, which cannot be translated into each other by continuous transformations. Comparison of the properties of bivectors and zero vectors under unitary transformations and their cyclic structures allows us to speak about the unambiguous correspondence of these algebras to charged particles and light. Thus, an algebraic substantiation of the key vector nature of the electromagnetic field for physics is given.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We build a combinatorial technique to solve several long standing problems in linear algebra with a particular focus on algorithmic complexity of matrix completion and tensor decomposition problems. For all appropriate integral domains R, we show the polynomial time equivalence of the problem of the solvability of a system of polynomial equations over R to &#8226; the minimum rank matrix completion problem (in particular, we answer a question asked by Buss, Frandsen, Shallit in 1999), &#8226; the determination of matrix rigidity (we answer a question posed by Mahajan, Sarma in 2010 by showing the undecidability over Z, and we solve recent problems of Ramya corresponding to Q and R), &#8226; the computation of tensor rank (we answer a question asked by Gonzalez, Ja'Ja' in 1980 on the undecidability over Z, and, additionally, the special case with R = Q solves a problem posed by Blaser in 2014), &#8226; the computation of the symmetric rank of a symmetric tensor, whose algorithimic complexity remained open despite an extensive discussion in several foundational papers. In particular, we prove the NP-hardness conjecture proposed by Hillar, Lim in 2013. In addition, we solve two problems on fractional minimal ranks of incomplete matrices recently raised by Grossmann, Woerdeman, and we answer, in a strong form, a recent question of Babai, Kivva on the dependence of the solution to the matrix rigidity problem on the choice of the target field.</div>

<div class='title'>A Universality Theorem for Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/yaroslav_shitov">Yaroslav Shitov</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Let A be a nonnegative matrix, that is, a matrix with nonnegative real entries. A nonnegative factorization of size k is a representation of A as a sum of k nonnegative rank-one matrices. The space of all such factorizations is a bounded semialgebraic set, and we prove that spaces arising in this way are universal. More presicely, we show that every bounded semialgebraic set U is rationally equivalent to the set of nonnegative size-k factorizations of some matrix A up to a permutation of matrices in the factorization. Our construction is effective, and we can compute a pair (A, k) in polynomial time from a given description of U as a system of polynomial inequalities with coefficients in Q. This result gives a complete description of the algorithmic complexity of several important problems, including the nonnegative matrix factorization, completely positive rank, nested polytope problem, and it also leads to a complete resolution of the problem of Cohen and Rothblum on nonnegative factorizations over different ordered fields.</div>

We study some properties of this concept in the context of matrix operations. We examine the behaviour of various matrix statistics in this setting. The crux will be to understanding the determinants and the eigenvalues of balanced matrices. It turns out that there does exist a direct communication among the leading entry, the trace, determinants and, hence, the eigenvalues of these matrices of order $2times 2$. These matrices have an interesting property that enables us to predict their quadratic forms, even without knowing their entries but given their spectrum.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mantzakouras_nikos">Mantzakouras Nikos</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Pythagorean theorem is perhaps the best known theorem in the vast world of mathematics.A simple relation of square numbers, which encapsulates all the glory of mathematical science, isalso justifiably the most popular yet sublime theorem in mathematical science. The starting pointwas Diophantus&#8217; 20 th problem (Book VI of Diophantus&#8217; Arithmetica), which for Fermat is for n= 4 and consists in the question whether there are right triangles whose sides can be measuredas integers and whose surface can be square. This problem was solved negatively by Fermat inthe 17 th century, who used the wonderful method (ipse dixit Fermat) of infinite descent. Thedifficulty of solving Fermat&#8217;s equation was first circumvented by Willes and R. Taylor in late1994 ([1],[2],[3],[4]) and published in Taylor and Willes (1995) and Willes (1995). We presentthe proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem and other accompanying theorems in 4 different independentways. For each of the methods we consider, we use the Pythagorean theorem as a basic principleand also the fact that the proof of the first degree Pythagorean triad is absolutely elementary anduseful. The proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem marks the end of a mathematical era; however, theurgent need for a more educational proof seems to be necessary for undergraduates and students ingeneral. Euler&#8217;s method and Willes&#8217; proof is still a method that does not exclude other equivalentmethods. The principle, of course, is the Pythagorean theorem and the Pythagorean triads, whichform the basis of all proofs and are also the main way of proving the Pythagorean theorem in anunderstandable way. Other forms of proofs we will do will show the dependence of the variableson each other. For a proof of Fermat&#8217;s theorem without the dependence of the variables cannotbe correct and will therefore give undefined and inconclusive results . It is, therefore, possible to prove Fermat's last theorem more simply and equivalently than the equation itself, without monomorphisms.</div>

For over a century, the Two Couriers Problem has been re-used in various forms as a mathemat- ical problem, in textbooks and journals, by different mathematicians and authors. The Two Couriers Problem involves cases where division by zero arises in practice, where each has a real-world, actual result for the solution. Thus the Two Couriers Problem is a centuries old algebra problem with actual applied results that involve division by zero. It is an excellent mathematical problem to evaluate different methods for dividing by zero. Division by zero has many different mathematical approaches. Conventional mathematics handles division by zero as an indeterminate or undefined result. Transmathematics defines division by zero as either nul- lity or explicitly positive or negative infinity. Two other approaches are by Saitoh, who defines division by zero simply as zero, and Baruk&#269;i&#263; who defines division by zero as either unity or explicitly positive or implicitly negativity infinity. The question is, which approach is best to solve the mathematical problem of division by zero? The paramount goal of this paper is to use the Two Couriers Problem as an objective test to examine and evaluate mathematical approaches to division by zero &#8211; and find which one is best.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We introduce a unimodular Determinant=1 8x8 rotation matrix to produce four 4 dimensional copies of H4 600-cells from the 240 vertices of the Split Real Even E8 Lie group. Unimodularity in the rotation matrix provides for the preservation of the 8 dimensional volume after rotation, which is useful in the application of the matrix in various fields, from theoretical particle physics to 3D visualization algorithm optimization.</div>

Explicit examples are provided for dimensions n' = 2,4,6, and the resulting inverses for n = n' +1 = 3,5,7.

<div class='abstract'>In this work I axiomatize the result of $x \cdot 0$ ($x\in\real_{\ne 0}$) as a number $\inull(x)$ that has a null real part (denoted as $\Re(\inull(x))=0$) but that is not real. This implies that $y+\Re(\inull(x)) = y$ but $y+\inull(x) = y + x\cdot 0 \not=y$, $y\in\real_{\ne 0}$. From this I define the set of null imaginary numbers $\nullset=\{\inull(x)=x\cdot 0|\forall x\in\real_{\ne 0}\}$ and present its elementary algebra taking the axiom of uniqueness as base (i.e., if $x\ne y\Leftrightarrow \inull(x)\ne \inull(y)$).

<div class='abstract'>The Triple Conformal Geometric Algebra (TCGA) for the Euclidean R^2-plane extends CGA as the product of three orthogonal CGAs, and thereby the representation of geometric entities to general cubic plane curves and certain cyclidic (or roulette) quartic, quintic, and sextic plane curves. The plane curve entities are 3-vectors that linearize the representation of non-linear curves, and the entities are inner product null spaces (IPNS) with respect to all points on the represented curves. Each IPNS entity also has a dual geometric outer product null space (OPNS) form. Orthogonal or conformal (angle-preserving) operations (as versors) are valid on all TCGA entities for inversions in circles, reflections in lines, and, by compositions thereof, isotropic dilations from a given center point, translations, and rotations around arbitrary points in the plane. A further dimensional extension of TCGA, also provides a method for anisotropic dilations. Intersections of any TCGA entity with a point, point pair, line or circle are possible. TCGA defines commutator-based differential operators in the coordinate directions that can be combined to yield a general n-directional derivative.</div>

Google is the most successful search engine in recent years,his research results are very complete and precise. When Google was an early research project at Stanford, several articles have been written describing the underlying algorithms. The dominant algorithm has been called PageRank and is still the key to providing accurate rankings for search results. A key feature of web search engines is sorting results associated with a query in order of importance or relevance. We present a model allowing to define a quantification of this concept (Pagerank) a priori fuzzy and elements of formalization for the numerical resolution of the problem. We begin with a natural first approach unsatisfactory in some cases. A refinement of the algorithm is introduced to improve the results.</div>

<div class='title'>On the K-Macga Mother Algebras of Conformal Geometric Algebras and the K-Cga Algebras</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_benjamin_easter">Robert Benjamin Easter</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This note very briefly describes or sketches the general ideas of some applications of the G(p,q) Geometric Algebra (GA) of a complex vector space C^(p,q) of signature (p,q), which is also known as the Clifford algebra Cl(p,q). Complex number scalars are only used for the anisotropic dilation (directed scaling) operation and to represent infinite distances, but otherwise only real number scalars are used. The anisotropic dilation operation is implemented in Minkowski spacetime as hyperbolic rotation (boost) by an imaginary rapidity (+/-)f = atanh(sqrt(1-d^2)) for dilation factor d&gt;1, using +f in the Minkowski spacetime of signature (1,n) and -f in the signature (n,1). The G(k(p+q+2),k(q+p+2)) Mother Algebra of CGA (k-MACGA) is a generalization of G(p+1,q+1) Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) having k orthogonal G(p+1,q+1):p&gt;q Euclidean CGA (ECGA) subalgebras and k orthogonal G(q+1,p+1) anti-Euclidean CGA (ACGA) subalgebras with opposite signature. Any k-MACGA has an even 2k total count of orthogonal subalgebras and cannot have an odd 2k+1 total count of orthogonal subalgebras. The more generalized G(l(p+1)+m(q+1),l (q+1)+m(p+1)):p&gt;q k-CGA algebra, for even or odd k=l+m, has any l orthogonal G(p+1,q+1) ECGA subalgebras and any m orthogonal G(q+1,p+1) ACGA subalgebras with opposite signature. Any 2k-CGA with even 2k orthogonal subalgebras can be represented as a k-MACGA with different signature, requiring some sign changes. All of the orthogonal CGA subalgebras are corresponding by representing the same vectors, geometric entities, and transformation versors in each CGA subalgebra, which may differ only by some sign changes. A k-MACGA or a 2k-CGA has even-grade 2k-vector geometric inner product null space (GIPNS) entities representing general even-degree 2k polynomial implicit hypersurface functions F for even-degree 2k hypersurfaces, usually in a p-dimensional space or (p+1)-spacetime. Only a k-CGA with odd k has odd-grade k-vector GIPNS entities representing general odd-degree k polynomial implicit hypersurface functions F for odd-degree k hypersurfaces, usually in a p-dimensional space or (p+1)-spacetime. In any k-CGA, there are k-blade GIPNS entities representing the usual G(p+1,q+1) CGA GIPNS 1-blade entities, but which are representing an implicit hypersurface function F^k with multiplicity k and the k-CGA null point entity is a k-point entity. In the conformal Minkowski spacetime algebras G(p+1,2) and G(2,p+1), the null 1-blade point embedding is a GOPNS null 1-blade point entity but is a GIPNS null 1-blade hypercone entity.</div>

This simply gives that how an AG-groupoid has closed connections with commutative algebras. We extend now for the first time the AG-Groupoid to the Neutrosophic AG-Groupoid.

It will be shown in this paper how (3 x 3) permutation matrices can be interpreted as unit vectors. &lt;b&gt; Special emphasis will be given to the definition of some wedge products which fit better to this algebra of (3 x 3) matrices than the usual Geometric Algebra wedge product. &lt;/b&gt; And as S3 permutation symmetry is flavour symmetry a unified flavour picture of Geometric Algebra will emerge.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/ralf_w_stephan">Ralf W. Stephan</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Using a personal computer and freely available software, the author factored some members of the Smarandache consecutive sequence and the reverse Smarandache sequence. Nearly complete factorizations are given up to Sm(80) and RSm(80). Both sequences were excessively searched for prime members, with only one prime found up to Sm(840) and RSm(750): RSm(82) = 828180 ... 10987654321.</div>
