<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/thomas_gunther">Thomas G&#252;nther</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The present article provides a detailed mathematical treatise on the geometry of skateboard transition ramps. These usually form a circular segment shape and are used in skateboarding for transitioning from a horizontal plane to another angle of incline. Transitions play a crucial role in the flow of skateparks and are required, for example, for quarter pipes, mini ramps, vert ramps, or jump ramps. Skateboarding has been an Olympic sport since 2023, yet many publicly funded skateparks still do not meet the demands of the sport. On one hand, there is often a lack of willingness from authorities to engage with the athletes beforehand; on the other hand, the people involved in the planning process often lack the necessary experience and mathematical expertise to perfectly fulfill the users' needs. Thoughtful planning is particularly crucial for ramps with curved surfaces to ensure the flow of the skatepark. In addition to the mathematical analysis, source codes for programs are provided to make the calculations as convenient as possible for all users.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we explore the properties and optimization techniques related to polyhedral cones and energy numbers with a focus on the cone of positive nxn semidefinite matrices and efficient computation strategies for kernels. In Part (a), we examine the polyhedral nature of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, S^n , establishing that it does not form a polyhedral cone for due to its infinite dimensional characteristics. In Part (b), we present an algorithm for efficiently computing the kernel function K(x, x prime) = (latex formatting in wysiwig)on-the-fly, leveraging a polyhedral description of the convex hull generated by the feature mappings phi and phi prime. By restructuring the problem and using gradient-based optimization techniques, our approach minimizes memory usage and computational overhead, thus enabling scalable computation. Through examples and visualizations, we demonstrate the practical applications and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in optimizing these kernel computations.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the local gluing one glues local neighborhoods around the critical point of the stable and unstable manifolds to gradient flow lines defined on a finite time interval [&#8722;T,T] for large T. If the Riemannian metric around the critical point is locally Euclidean, the local gluing map can be written down explicitly. In the non-Euclidean case the construction of the local gluing map requires an intricate version of the implicit function theorem.In this paper we explain a functional analytic approach how the local gluing map can be defined. For that we are working on infinite dimensional path spaces and also interpret stable and unstable manifolds as submanifolds of path spaces. The advantage of this approach is that similar functional analytical techniques can as well be generalized to infinite dimensional versions of Morse theory, for example Floer theory.A crucial ingredient is the Newton-Picard map. We work out an abstract version of it which does not involve troublesome quadratic estimates.</div>

<div class='title'>Finding Rational Points of Circles, Spheres, Hyper-Spheres via Stereographic Projection and Quantum Mechanics}</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/carlos_castro">Carlos Castro</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>One of the consequences of Fermat's last theorem is the existence of a countable infinite number of rational points on the unit circle, which allows in turn, to find the rational points on the unit sphere via the inverse stereographic projection of the homothecies of the rational points on the unit circle. We proceed to iterate this process and obtain the rational points on the unit $S^3$ via the inverse stereographic projection of the homothecies of the rational points on the previous unit $S^2$. One may continue this iteration/recursion process ad infinitum in order to find the rational points on unit hyper-spheres of arbitrary dimension $S^4, S^5, cdots, S^N$. As an example, it is shown how to obtain the rational points of the unit $ S^{24}$ that is associated with the Leech lattice. The physical applications of our construction follow and one finds a direct relation among the $N+1$ quantum states of a spin-N/2 particle and the rational points of a unit $S^N$ hyper-sphere embedded in a flat Euclidean $R^{N+1}$ space.</div>

<div class='title'>Linear-Time Estimation of Smooth Rotations in ARAP Surface Deformation</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/mauricio_cele_lopez_belon">Mauricio Cele Lopez Belon</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In recent years the As-Rigid-As-Possible with Smooth Rotations (SR-ARAP [5]) technique has gained popularity in applications where an isometric-type of surface mapping is needed. The advantage of SR-ARAP is that quality of deformation results is comparable to more costly volumetric techniques operating on tetrahedral meshes. The SR-ARAP relies on local/global optimisation approach to minimise the non-linear least squares energy. The power of this technique resides on the local step. The local step estimates the local rotation of a small surface region, or cell, with respect of its neighbouring cells, so a local change in one cell&#8217;s rotation affect the neighbouring cell&#8217;s rotations and vice-versa. The main drawback of this technique is that the local step requires a global convergence of rotation changes. Currently the local step is solved in an iterative fashion, where the number of iterations needed to reach convergence can be prohibitively large and so, in practice, only a fixed number of iterations is possible. This trade-off is, in some sense, defeating the goal of SR-ARAP. We propose a linear-time closed-form solution for estimating the codependent rotations of the local step by solving a sparse linear system of equations. Our method is more efficient than state-of-the-art since no iterations are needed and optimised sparse linear solvers can be leveraged to solve this step in linear time. It is also more accurate since this is a closed-form solution. We apply our method to generate interactive surface deformation, we also show how a multiresolution optimisation can be applied to achieve real-time animation of large surfaces.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Critical points of a function subject to a constraint can be either detected by restricting the function to the constraint or by looking for critical points of the Lagrange multiplier functional. Although the critical points of the two functionals, namely the restriction and the Lagrange multiplier functional are in natural one-to-one correspondence this does not need to be true for their gradient flow lines. We consider a singular deformation of the metric and show by an adiabatic limit argument that close to the singularity we have a one-to-one correspondence between gradient flow lines connecting critical points of Morse index difference one. We present a general overview of the adiabatic limit technique in the article [FW22b].The proof of the correspondence is carried out in two parts. The current part I deals with linear methods leading to a singular version of the implicit function theorem. We also discuss possible infinite dimensional generalizations in Rabinowitz-Floer homology. In part II [FW22a] we apply non-linear methods and prove, in particular, a compactness result and uniform exponential decay independent of the deformation parameter.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this second part to [FW22a] we finish the proof of the one-to-one correspondence of gradient flow lines of index difference one between the restricted functional and the Lagrange multiplier functional for deformation parameters of the metric close to the singular one. In particular, we prove that, although the metric becomes singular, we have uniform bounds for the Lagrange multiplier of finite energy solutions and all its derivatives. This uniform bound is the crucial ingredient for a compactness theorem for gradient flow lines of arbitrary deformation parameter. If the functionals are Morse we further prove uniform exponential decay. We finally show combined with the linear theory in part I that if the metric is Morse-Smale the adiabatic limit map is bijective. We present a general overview of the adiabatic limit technique in the article [FW22b].</div>

<div class='title'>Quantum Impedance Networks of Dark Matter and Energy</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/peter_cameron">Peter Cameron</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Dark matter has two independent origins in the impedance model: Geometrically, extending two-component Dirac spinors to the full 3D Pauli algebra eight-component wavefunction permits calculating quantum impedance networks of wavefunction interactions. Impedance matching governs amplitude and phase of energy flow. While vacuum wavefunction is the same at all scales, flux quantization of wavefunction components yields different energies and physics as scale changes, with corresponding enormous impedance mismatches when moving far from Compton wavelengths, decoupling the dynamics. Topologically, extending wavefunctions to the full eight components introduces magnetic charge, pseudoscalar dual of scalar electric charge. Coupling to the photon is reciprocal of electric, inverting fundamental lengths - Rydberg, Bohr, classical, and Higgs - about the charge-free Compton wavelength $lambda=h/mc$. To radiate a photon, Bohr cannot be inside Compton, Rydberg inside Bohr,... Topological inversion renders magnetic charge `dark'.Dark energy mixes geometry and topology, translation and rotation gauge fields. Impedance matching to the Planck length event horizon exposes an identity between gravitation and mismatched electromagnetism. Fields of wavefunction components propagate away from confinement scale, are reflected back by vacuum wavefunction mismatches they excite. This attenuation of the `Hawking graviton' wavefunction results in exponentially increasing wavelengths, ultimately greater than radius of the observable universe. Graviton oscillation between translation and rotation gauge fields exchanges linear and angular momentum, is an invitation to modified Newtonian dynamics.</div>

<div class='abstract'>To help fill the need for examples of introductory-level problems that have been solved via Geometric Algebra (GA), we show how to calculate the angle through which two unit vectors must be rotated in order to be parallel to each other. Among the ideas that we use are a transformation of the usual GA formula for rotations, and the use of GA products to eliminated variables in simultaneous equations. We will show the benefits of (1) examining an interactive GeoGebra construction before attempting a solution, and (2) considering a range of implications of the given information.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jose_risomar_sousa">Jose Risomar Sousa</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper we derive the possibly simplest integral representations for the Riemann zeta function and its generalizations (the Lerch function, $\Phi(e^m,-k,b)$, the Hurwitz zeta, $\zeta(-k,b)$, and the polylogarithm, $\mathrm{Li}_{-k}(e^m)$), valid in the whole complex plane relative to all parameters, except for singularities. We also present the relations between each of these functions and their partial sums. It allows one to figure, for example, the Taylor series expansion of $H_{-k}(n)$ about $n=0$ (when $-k$ is a positive integer, we obtain a finite Taylor series, which is nothing but the Faulhaber formula). With these relations, one can also obtain the simplest integral representation of the derivatives of the zeta function at zero. The method used requires evaluating the limit of $\Phi\left(e^{2\pi\ii\,x},-2k+1,n+1\right)+\pi\ii\,x\,\Phi\left(e^{2\pi\ii\,x},-2k,n+1\right)/k$ when $x$ goes to $0$, which in itself already constitutes an interesting problem.</div>

<div class='title'>Division by Zero Calculus and Euclidean Geometry - Revolution in Euclidean Geometry</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we will discuss Euclidean geometry from the viewpoint of the division by zero calculus with typical examples. Where is the point at infinity? It seems that the point is vague in Euclidean geometry in a sense. Certainly we can see the point at infinity with the classical Riemann sphere. However, by the division by zero and division by zero calculus, we found that the Riemann sphere is not suitable, but D\&quot;aumler's horn torus model is suitable that shows the coincidence of the zero point and the point at infinity. Therefore, Euclidean geometry is extended globally to the point at infinity. This will give a great revolution of Euclidean geometry. The impacts are wide and therefore, we will show their essence with several typical examples.</div>

<div class='title'>Proving Unproved Euclidean Propositions on a New Foundational Basis</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/antonio_leon">Antonio Leon</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This article introduces a new foundation for Euclidean geometry more productive than other classical and modern alternatives. Some well-known classical propositions that were proved to be unprovable on the basis of other foundations of Euclidean geometry can now be proved within the new foundational framework. Ten axioms, 28 definitions and 40 corollaries are the key elements of the new formal basis. The axioms are totally new, except Axiom 5 (a light form of Euclid&#8217;s Postulate 1), and Axiom 8 (an extended version of Euclid&#8217;s Postulate 3). The definitions include productive definitions of concepts so far primitive, or formally unproductive, as straight line, angle or plane The new foundation allow to prove, among other results, the following axiomatic statements: Euclid's First Postulate, Euclid's Second Postulate, Hilbert's Axioms I.5, II.1, II.2, II.3, II.4 and IV.6, Euclid's Postulate 4, Posidonius-Geminus' Axiom, Proclus' Axiom, Cataldi's Axiom, Tacquet's Axiom 11, Khayyam's Axiom, Playfair's Axiom, and an extended version of Euclid's Fifth Postulate.</div>

<div class='abstract'>We provide a formula that expresses the number of (n &#8722; 2)-gaps of a generic digital n-object.

This approach seems suitable as a model for an automatic computation, and also allow us to find some expressions for the maximum number of i-cells that bound or are bounded by a fixed j-cell.</div>

With small model preserving modifications, it is possible to consistently define in conic CGA versors for rotation, translation and scaling, similar to Hrdina et al. (Adv. Appl Cliff. Algs.

<div class='abstract'>Computer-aided Design (CAD) models of thin-walled parts such as sheet metal or plastics are often reduced dimensionally to their corresponding midsurfaces for quicker and fairly accurate results of Computer-aided Engineering (CAE) analysis. Generation of the midsurface is still a time-consuming and mostly, a manual task due to lack of robust and automated techniques. Midsurface failures manifest in the form of gaps, overlaps, not-lying-halfway, etc., which can take hours or even days to correct. Most of the existing techniques work on the complex &#64257;nal shape of the model forcing the usage of hard-coded heuristic rules, developed on a case-by-case basis. The research presented here proposes to address these problems by leveraging feature-parameters, made available by the modern feature-based CAD applications, and by effectively leveraging them for sub-processes such as simpli&#64257;cation, abstraction and decomposition. In the proposed system, at &#64257;rst, features which are not part of the gross shape are removed from the input sheet metal feature-based CAD model. Features of the gross-shape model are then transformed into their corresponding generic feature equivalents, each having a pro&#64257;le and a guide curve. The abstracted model is then decomposed into non-overlapping cellular bodies. The cells are classi&#64257;ed into midsurface-patch generating cells, called &#8216;solid cells&#8217; and patch-connecting cells, called &#8216;interface cells&#8217;. In solid cells, midsurface patches are generated either by offset or by sweeping the midcurve generated from the owner-feature&#8217;s pro&#64257;le. Interface cells join all the midsurface patches incident upon them. Output midsurface is then validated for correctness. At the end, real-life parts are used to demonstrate the ef&#64257;cacy of the approach.</div>

<div class='abstract'>As a demonstration of the coherence of Geometric Algebra's (GA's) geometric and algebraic concepts of bivectors, we add three geometric bivectors according to the procedure described by Hestenes and Macdonald, then use bivector identities to determine, from the result, two bivectors whose outer product is equal to the initial sum. In this way, we show that the procedure that GA's inventors dened for adding geometric bivectors is precisely that which is needed to give results that coincide with those obtained by calculating outer products of vectors that are expressed in terms of a 3D basis. We explain that that accomplishment is no coincidence: it is a consequence of the attributes that GA's designers assigned (or didn't) to bivectors.</div>

<div class='title'>On Surface Measures on Convex Bodies and Generalizations of Known Tangential Identities</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/johan_aspegren">Johan Aspegren</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>One theme of this paper is to extend known results from polygons and balls to the general convex bodies in n&#8722; dimensions. An another theme stems from approximating a convex surface with polytope surface. Our result gives a sufficient and necessary condition for an natural approximation method to succeed (in principle) in the case of surfaces of convex bodies. Thus, Schwartz`s paradox does not affect our method. This allows us to denefine certain surface measures on surfaces of convex bodies in a novel and simple way.</div>

<div class='title'>Learning Geometric Algebra by Modeling Motions of the Earth and Shadows of Gnomons to Predict Solar Azimuths and Altitudes</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/james_a_smith">James A. Smith</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Because the shortage of worked-out examples at introductory levels is an obstacle to widespread adoption of Geometric Algebra (GA), we use GA to calculate Solar azimuths and altitudes as a function of time via the heliocentric model. We begin by representing the Earth's motions in GA terms. Our representation incorporates an estimate of the time at which the Earth would have reached perihelion in 2017 if not affected by the Moon's gravity. Using the geometry of the December 2016 solstice as a starting point, we then employ GA's capacities for handling rotations to determine the orientation of a gnomon at any given latitude and longitude during the period between the December solstices of 2016 and 2017. Subsequently, we derive equations for two angles: that between the Sun's rays and the gnomon's shaft, and that between the gnomon's shadow and the direction ``north&quot; as traced on the ground at the gnomon's location. To validate our equations, we convert those angles to Solar azimuths and altitudes for comparison with simulations made by the program Stellarium. As further validation, we analyze our equations algebraically to predict (for example) the precise timings and locations of sunrises, sunsets, and Solar zeniths on the solstices and equinoxes. We emphasize that the accuracy of the results is only to be expected, given the high accuracy of the heliocentric model itself, and that the relevance of this work is the efficiency with which that model can be implemented via GA for teaching at the introductory level. On that point, comments and debate are encouraged and welcome.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Published times of the Earth's perihelions do not refer to the perihelions of the orbit that the Earth would follow if unaffected by other bodies such as the Moon. To estimate the timing of that ``unperturbed&quot; perihelion, we fit an unperturbed Kepler orbit to the timings of the year 2017's equinoxes and solstices. We find that the unperturbed 2017 perihelion, defined in that way, would occur 12.93 days after the December 2016 solstice. Using that result, calculated times of the year 2017's solstices and equinoxes differ from published values by less than five minutes. That degree of accuracy is sufficient for the intended use of the result.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The derivation of multilinear forms used to compute the moments of sets bounded by subdivision surfaces requires solving a number of systems of linear equations. As the support of the subdivision mask or the degree of the moment grows, the corresponding linear system becomes intractable to construct, let alone to solve by Gaussian elimination. In the paper, we argue that the power iteration and the geometric series are feasible methods to approximate the multilinear forms. The tensor iterations investigated in this work are shown to converge at favorable rates, achieve arbitrary numerical accuracy, and have a small memory footprint. In particular, our approach makes it possible to compute the volume, centroid, and inertia of spatial domains bounded by Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision surfaces.</div>

The Wikipedia article that's current as of this writing has an extensive description of the problem's history, and of methods that have been used to solve it. As described in that article, one of the methods reduces the &quot;two circles and a line&quot; variant to the so-called &quot;Circle-Line-Point&quot; (CLP) special case: Given a circle C, a line L, and a point P, construct the circles that are tangent to C and L, and pass through P.

<div class='abstract'>Note: The Appendix to this new version gives an alternate--and much simpler--solution that does not use reflections. The beautiful Problem of Apollonius from classical geometry (&quot;Construct all of the circles that are tangent, simultaneously, to three given coplanar circles&quot;) does not appear to have been solved previously by vector methods. It is solved here via Geometric Algebra (GA, also known as Clifford Algebra) to show students how they can make use of GA's capabilities for expressing and manipulating rotations and reflections. As Vi&#232;te did when deriving his ruler-and-compass solution, we first transform the problem by shrinking one of the given circles to a point. In the course of solving the transformed problem, guidance is provided to help students ``see&quot; geometric content in GA terms. Examples of the guidance that is given include (1) recognizing and formulating useful reflections and rotations that are present in diagrams; (2) using postulates on the equality of multivectors to obtain solvable equations; and (3) recognizing complex algebraic expressions that reduce to simple rotations of multivectors. As an aid to students, the author has prepared a dynamic-geometry construction to accompany this article.</div>

<div class='title'>Double Conformal Geometric Algebras</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_benjamin_easter">Robert Benjamin Easter</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper gives an overview of two different, but closely related, double conformal geometric algebras. The first is the G(8,2) Double Conformal / Darboux Cyclide Geometric Algebra (DCGA), and the second is the G(4,8) Double Conformal Space-Time Algebra (DCSTA). DCSTA is a straightforward extension of DCGA. The double conformal geometric algebras that are presented in this paper have a large set of operations that are valid on general quadric surface entities. These operations include rotation, translation, isotropic dilation, spacetime boost, anisotropic dilation, differentiation, reflection in standard entities, projection onto standard entities, and intersection with standard entities. However, the quadric surface entities and other &quot;non-standard entities&quot; cannot be intersected with each other.</div>

<div class='title'>The Impossible is Possible! Squaring the Circle and Doubling the Cube in Space-Time</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/espen_gaarder_haug">Espen Gaarder Haug</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Squaring the Circle is a famous geometry problem going all the way back to the ancient Greeks. It is the great quest of constructing a square with the same area as a circle using a compass and straightedge in a finite number of steps. Since it was proven that &#960; was a transcendental number in 1882, the task of Squaring the Circle has been considered impossible. Here, we will show it is possible to Square the Circle in space-time. It is not possible to Square the Circle in Euclidean space alone, but it is fully possible in space-time, and after all we live in a world with not only space, but also time. By drawing the circle from one reference frame and drawing the square from another reference frame, we can indeed Square the Circle. By taking into account space-time rather than just space the Impossible is possible! However, it is not enough simply to understand math in order to Square the Circle, one must understand some &#8220;basic&#8221; space-time physics as well. As a bonus we have added a solution to the impossibility of Doubling the Cube. As a double bonus we also have also Boxed the Sphere! As one will see, one can claim we simply have bent the rules and moved a problem from one place to another. One of the main essences of this paper is that we can move challenging space problems out from space and into time, and vice versa.</div>

<div class='title'>Differential Operators in the G8,2 Geometric Algebra, DCGA</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_benjamin_easter">Robert Benjamin Easter</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper introduces the differential operators in the G(8,2) Geometric Algebra, called the Double Conformal / Darboux Cyclide Geometric Algebra (DCGA). The differential operators are three x, y, and z-direction bivector-valued differential elements and either the commutator product or the anti-commutator product for multiplication into a geometric entity that represents the function to be differentiated. The general form of a function is limited to a Darboux cyclide implicit surface function. Using the commutator product, entities representing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd order partial derivatives in x, y, and z can be produced. Using the anti-commutator product, entities representing the anti-derivation can be produced from 2-vector quadric surface and 4-vector conic section entities. An operator called the pseudo-integral is defined and has the property of raising the x, y, or z degree of a function represented by an entity, but it does not produce a true integral. The paper concludes by offering some basic relations to limited forms of vector calculus and differential equations that are limited to using Darboux cyclide implicit surface functions. An example is given of entity analysis for extracting the parameters of an ellipsoid entity using the differential operators.</div>

Operations include reflection, projection, rejection, and intersection with respect to spheres and planes. Other operations include rotation, translation, and dilation.

<div class='title'>G8,2 Geometric Algebra, DCGA</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/robert_benjamin_easter">Robert Benjamin Easter</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper introduces the Double Conformal / Darboux Cyclide Geometric Algebra (DCGA), based in the G8,2 Clifford geometric algebra. DCGA is an extension of CGA and has entities representing points and general Darboux cyclide surfaces in Euclidean 3D space. The general Darboux cyclide is a quartic surface. Darboux cyclides include circular tori and all quadrics, and also all surfaces formed by their inversions in spheres. Dupin cyclide surfaces can be formed as inversions in spheres of circular toroid, cylinder, and cone surfaces. Parabolic cyclides are cubic surfaces formed by inversion spheres centered on other surfaces. All DCGA entities can be conformally transformed in 3D space by rotors, dilators, translators, and motors, which are all types of versors. All entities can be inversed in general spheres and reflected in general planes. Entities representing the intersections of surfaces can be created by wedge products. All entities can be intersected with spheres, planes, lines, and circles. DCGA provides a higher-level algebra for working with 3D geometry in an object/entity-oriented system of mathematics above the level of the underlying implicit surface equations of algebraic geometry. DCGA could be used in the study of geometry in 3D, and also for some applications.</div>

<div class='title'>The Orthogonal Planes Split of Quaternions and Its Relation to Quaternion Geometry of Rotations</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/eckhard_hitzer">Eckhard Hitzer</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recently the general orthogonal planes split with respect to any two pure unit quaternions $f,g \in \mathbb{H}$, $f^2=g^2=-1$, including the case $f=g$, has proved extremely useful for the construction and geometric interpretation of general classes of double-kernel quaternion Fourier transformations (QFT) [E.Hitzer, S.J. Sangwine, The orthogonal 2D planes split of quaternions and steerable quaternion Fourier Transforms, in E. Hitzer, S.J. Sangwine (eds.), &quot;Quaternion and Clifford Fourier Transforms and Wavelets&quot;, TIM \textbf{27}, Birkhauser, Basel, 2013, 15--39.]. Applications include color image processing, where the orthogonal planes split with $f=g=$ the grayline, naturally splits a pure quaternionic three-dimensional color signal into luminance and chrominance components. Yet it is found independently in the quaternion geometry of rotations [L. Meister, H. Schaeben, A concise quaternon geometry of rotations, MMAS 2005; \textbf{28}: 101--126], that the pure quaternion units $f,g$ and the analysis planes, which they define, play a key role in the spherical geometry of rotations, and the geometrical interpretation of integrals related to the spherical Radon transform of probability density functions of unit quaternions, as relevant for texture analysis in crystallography. In our contribution we further investigate these connections.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this brief note, we introduce the new, emerging sub-discipline of iso-fractals by highlighting and discussing the preliminary results of recent works. First, we note the abundance of fractal, chaotic, non-linear, and self-similar structures in nature while emphasizing the importance of studying such systems because fractal geometry is the language of chaos. Second, we outline the iso-fractal generalization of the Mandelbrot set to exemplify the newly generated Mandelbrot iso-sets. Third, we present the cutting-edge notion of dynamic iso-spaces and explain how a mathematical space can be iso-topically lifted with iso-unit functions that (continuously or discretely) change; in the discrete case examples, we mention that iteratively generated sequences like Fibonacci's numbers and (the complex moduli of) Mandelbrot's numbers can supply a deterministic chain of iso-units to construct an ordered series of (magnified and/or de-magnified) iso-spaces that are locally iso-morphic. Fourth, we consider the initiation of iso-fractals with Inopin's holographic ring (IHR) topology and fractional statistics for 2D and 3D iso-spaces. In total, the reviewed iso-fractal results are a significant improvement over traditional fractals because the application of Santilli's iso-mathematics arms us an extra degree of freedom for attacking problems in chaos. Finally, we conclude by proposing some questions and ideas for future research work.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this work, we deploy Santilli's iso-dual iso-topic lifting and Inopin's holographic ring (IHR) topology as a platform to introduce and assemble a tesseract from two inter-locking, iso-morphic, iso-dual cubes in Euclidean triplex space. For this, we prove that such an &quot;iso-dual tesseract&quot; can be constructed by following a procedure of simple, flexible, topologically-preserving instructions. Moreover, these novel results are significant because the tesseract's state and structure are directly inferred from the one initial cube (rather than two distinct cubes), which identifies a new iso-geometrical inter-connection between Santilli's exterior and interior dynamical systems.</div>

As a useful way of purchasing, there are many norms and rulers for it in the purchasing guides of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,..., also in contract conditions of various consultant associations. In China, there is a law and regulation system for tendering and bidding. However, few works on the mathematical model of a tendering and its evaluation can be found in publication. The main purpose of this paper is to construct a Smarandache multi-space model for a tendering, establish an evaluation system for bidding based on those ideas in the references [7] and [8] and analyze its solution by applying the decision approach for multiple objectives and value engineering. Open problems for pseudo-multi-spaces are also presented in the final section.</div>

<div class='title'>Pseudo-Manifold Geometries with Applications</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/linfan_mao">Linfan Mao</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A Smarandache geometry is a geometry which has at least one Smarandachely denied axiom(1969), i.e., an axiom behaves in at least two different ways within the same space, i.e., validated and invalided, or only invalided but in multiple distinct ways and a Smarandache n-manifold is a n-manifold that support a Smarandache geometry. Iseri provided a construction for Smarandache 2-manifolds by equilateral triangular disks on a plane and a more general way for Smarandache 2-manifolds on surfaces, called map geometries was presented by the author in [9]-[10] and [12]. However, few observations for cases of n &ge; 3 are found on the journals. As a kind of Smarandache geometries, a general way for constructing dimensional n pseudo-manifolds are presented for any integer n &ge; 2 in this paper. Connection and principal fiber bundles are also defined on these manifolds. Following these constructions, nearly all existent geometries, such as those of Euclid geometry, Lobachevshy-Bolyai geometry, Riemann geometry, Weyl geometry, K&auml;hler geometry and Finsler geometry, ...,etc., are their sub-geometries.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Combinatorics is a powerful tool for dealing with relations among objectives mushroomed in the past century. However, an more important work for mathematician is to apply combinatorics to other mathematics and other sciences not merely to find combinatorial behavior for objectives. Recently, such research works appeared on journals for mathematics and theoretical physics on cosmos. The main purpose of this paper is to survey these thinking and ideas for mathematics and cosmological physics, such as those of multi-spaces, map geometries and combinatorial cosmoses, also the combinatorial conjecture for mathematics proposed by myself in 2005. Some open problems are included for the 21th mathematics by a combinatorial speculation.</div>

<div class='title'>Microscopes and Telescopes for Theoretical Physics : How Rich Locally and Large Globally is the Geometric Straight Line ?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/elemer_e_rosinger">Elem&eacute;r E Rosinger</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>One is reminded in this paper of the often overlooked fact that the geometric straight line, or GSL, of Euclidean geometry is not necessarily identical with its usual Cartesian coordinatisation given by the real numbers in &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;. Indeed, the GSL is an abstract idea, while the Cartesian, or for that matter, any other specific coordinatisation of it is but one of the possible mathematical models chosen upon certain reasons. And as is known, there are a a variety of mathematical models of GSL, among them given by nonstandard analysis, reduced power algebras, the topological long line, or the surreal numbers, among others. As shown in this paper, the GSL can allow coordinatisations which are arbitrarily more rich locally and also more large globally, being given by corresponding linearly ordered sets of no matter how large cardinal. Thus one can obtain in relatively simple ways structures which are more rich locally and large globally than in nonstandard analysis, or in various reduced power algebras. Furthermore, vector space structures can be defined in such coordinatisations. Consequently, one can define an extension of the usual Differential Calculus. This fact can have a major importance in physics, since such locally more rich and globally more large coordinatisations of the GSL do allow new physical insights, just as the introduction of various microscopes and telescopes have done. Among others, it and general can reassess special relativity with respect to its independence of the mathematical models used for the GSL. Also, it can allow the more appropriate modelling of certain physical phenomena. One of the long vexing issue of so called &#65533;infinities in physics&#65533; can obtain a clarifying reconsideration. It indeed all comes down to looking at the GSL with suitably constructed microscopes and telescopes, and apply the resulted new modelling possibilities in theoretical physics. One may as well consider that in string theory, for instance, where several dimensions are supposed to be compact to the extent of not being observable on classical scales, their mathematical modelling may benefit from the presence of infinitesimals in the mathematical models of the GSL presented here. However, beyond all such particular considerations, and not unlikely also above them, is the following one : theories of physics should be not only background independent, but quite likely, should also be independent of the specific mathematical models used when representing geometry, numbers, and in particular, the GSL. One of the consequences of considering the essential difference between the GSL and its various mathematical models is that what appears to be the definitive answer is given to the intriguing question raised by Penrose : &#65533;Why is it that physics never uses spaces with a cardinal larger than that of the continuum ?&#65533;.</div>

<div class='title'>Differentiable Structures on Real Grassmannians</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jeidsan_a_c_pereira">Jeidsan A. C. Pereira</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Given a vector space V of dimension n and a natural number k &lt; n, the grassmannian G&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(V) is defined as the set of all subspaces W &sub; V such that dim(W) = k. In the case of V = R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(V) is the set of k-fl ats in R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and is called real grassmannian [1]. Recently the study of these manifolds has found applicability in several areas of mathematics, especially in Modern Differential Geometry and Algebraic Geometry. This work will build two differential structures on the real grassmannian, one of which is obtained as a quotient space of a Lie group [1], [3], [2], [7]</div>
