<div class='abstract'>Global Health sometimes faces pandemics as are currently facing COVID-19 disease. The spreading and infection factors of this disease are very high. A huge number of people from most of the countries are infected within six months from its first report of appearance and it keeps spreading. The required systems are not ready up to some stages for any pandemic; therefore, mitigation with existing capacity becomes necessary. On the other hand, modern-era largely depends on Artificial Intelligence(AI) including Data Science; Deep Learning(DL) is one of the current flag-bearer of these techniques. It could use to mitigate COVID-19 like pandemics in terms of stop spread, diagnosis of the disease, drug & vaccine discovery, treatment, and many more. But this DL requires large datasets as well as powerful computing resources. A shortage of reliable datasets of a running pandemic is a common phenomenon. So, Deep Transfer Learning(DTL) would be effective as it learns from one task and could work on another task. In addition, Edge Devices(ED) such as IoT, Webcam, Drone, Intelligent Medical Equipment, Robot, etc. are very useful in a pandemic situation. These types of equipment make the infrastructures sophisticated and automated which helps to cope with an outbreak. But these are equipped with low computing resources, so, applying DL is also a bit challenging; therefore, DTL also would be effective there. This article scholarly studies the potentiality and challenges of these issues. It has described relevant technical backgrounds and reviews of the related recent state-of-the-art. This article also draws a pipeline of DTL over Edge Computing as a future scope to assist the mitigation of any pandemic.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/anindya_kumar_biswas">Anindya Kumar Biswas</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We study A Dictionary of Plant Sciences, the fourth edition, by Michael Allaby from the Oxford University Press. We draw the natural logarithm of the number of entries, normalised, starting with a letter vs the natural logarithm of the rank of the letter, normalised. We conclude that the Dictionary can be characterised by BP(4, $\beta H=0.02$), i.e. the Bethe-Peierls curve in the presence of four nearest neighbours and little external magnetic field, $\beta H= 0.02$. $\beta$ is $\frac{1}{k_{B}T}$ where, T is temperature and $k_{B}$ is the tiny Boltzmann constant. This is the case with A Dictionary Of Psychology by A. M. Colman from the Oxford University Press we have studied before. It appears that the branch of Plant Sciences is tantalizingly closer to the branch of Psychology, internally.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jesus_malo_lopez">Jesus Malo Lopez</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Contrast Sensitivity of the human visual system can be explained from certain low-level vision tasks (like retinal noise and optical blur removal), but not from others (like chromatic adaptation or pure reconstruction after simple bottlenecks). This conclusion still holds even under substantial change in stimulus statistics, as for instance considering cartoon-like images as opposed to natural images (Li, Gomez-Villa, Bertalmio, & Malo, 2022). In this note we present a method to generate original cartoon-like images compatible with the statistical training used in (Li et al., 2022). Following the classical observation in (Magritte, 1929), the stimuli generated by the proposed method certainly are not what they represent: Ceci n&#8217;est pas une pipe. The clear distinction between representation (the stimuli generated by the proposed method) and reality (the actual object) avoids eventual problems for the use of the generated stimuli in academic, non-profit, publications.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In this research, we show that by mixing cells of plants and animals, a new type of alive creature or life is emerged. To this aim, we cut the skin of some quails and create a hole between skin and skeleton. We put some some beans and lentils in this hole and cover it by a black glue. We open the hole after a week and observe that a bridge of quail's cells is produced between beans and lentils. This bridge has the genus of the periosteum that covers the outer surface of all bones. In this periosteum, there are some stem cells that produce a collection of neuronal circuits. These circuits could join to each other and form a little brain. This brain can control all voluntary and non-voluntary actions of this new alive creature.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alireza_sepehri">Alireza Sepehri</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A shell less culture system for chick embryo could be used to produce a clever battery or bio-computer. In this system, after 50 hourses after incubatating, a heart is emerged which send blood molecules to each side and produces a biological current. This current carries charged particles and molecules and creates an electrical current and differences potential between center of heart and sides of shell-less vessels. If we put two metal bars in center and side of vessel, we can take electrical current and use of it industry. This causes that shell-less culture system plays the role of battery. This battery is clever and by closing another shell less culture system produce different currents. This is because that a collections of neurons are emerged on the heart in shell less cuture system which plays the role of a little brain. This little brain exchange information with medium and control voluntary actions of system For this reason, this system not only has the role of battery but also could be used as a bio-computer.</div>

<div class='title'>Using Spiral Waves of the Little Brain on the Heart for Designing New Neuronal Circuits in Brain</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alireza_sepehri">Alireza Sepehri</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Recently, some authors have considered the spiral waves in neuronal systems and proposed a model for it. We generalize their consideration to radiated waves from the little brain on the heart of birds to design new neuranal circuits in brain. First, we put two chick embryos in an inductor and send a current by a generator. Radiated waves of chick embryos change the initial current and produce an oscillating current which can be observed by an scope. Using this system, we consider the exchanged spiral waves between two little brains on the hearts of two chick embryos and show that they have direct effects on the life, death and other activities of each other. We put two chick embryos of two different types in this inductor and control the process of formation of neuronal circuits. Each type has it's own circuits and thus, exchanged spiral waves between two chick embryos may change shape of neuronal circuits in each type. Comparing radiated signals of a chick embryo which was under radiation in this inductor with a normal chick embryo without experiencing external wave, we can consider differences between neuronal circuits.</div>

<div class='title'>The Role of Radiated Non-Linear Electromagnetic Waves from Initial Dnas in Formation of the Little Brain, Neural Circuits and Other Decision Centers: Determining Time of Death by Considering Evolutions of Waves of Death</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alireza_sepehri">Alireza Sepehri</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this research, we find that after formation of initial DNAs of chick embryo, they exchange electromagnetic signals with medium and each other. In fact, each gene of these DNAs act like the reciever or sender of radio waves. To control the process of transferring information, some circuits are emerged that each circuit depends on the activity of one gene. Because of various types of emitted waves, each neuron has several types of terminals in dendrite and axon to receive and send these waves. Before formation of neurons, initial informations are transmitted by blood molecules. Because of the role of blood molecules in transferring initial information, first circuits are formed on the heart and build the little brain . However, eventually, some circuits are emerged on the head which construct the brain. We bring some reasons for the existence of the little brain. We connect a chick embryo to an scope and observe evolutions of waves during formation of the little brain and the main brain. In absence of brain, the little brain emit some signals, while by passing time and formation of brain, the interaction between these systems leads to an increase in radiated waves. Then, we put two shell-less cultures of chick embryos in an inductor, apply a magnetic field to both of them and show that little brains of these systems interact with each other and change the value of output magnetic field and currents. Next, we consider signals of the little brain of the birds during removing their heads. We find that always, brain send some signals to the little brain and inform it of the end of life. However, if removing is done suddenly, these waves couldnt be exchanged and heart continue to work. This produce some hopes to cure patients.</div>

<div class='title'>New Research Shall be Initiated in Regard with the Effects of Mood Alternation During Neurological Shutdown</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/peiman_ghasemi">Peiman Ghasemi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In 1994 the Death With Dignity Act was first passed by Oregon voters successfully, and it became the first law in American history permitting physician-assisted suicide. Pain and negative mental feelings and physical unconsciousness about the future events in the Universe are getting considered as the only disadvantages of the death. Aside of the issues of human cloning and mind uploading for making progress towards eternity of life, complementary researches in-regard-with the effects of mood alternation during neurological shutdown shall be initiated. Alternation on the human feelings by stimulation of the brain's synapses would lead to a more peaceful mental shutdown. The pain's circuit (the circuit of negative emotions during the death) shall be extracted and gets stimulated during the death. The stimulation of the circuit usually begins right after the act of suicide and suppression of the oxygen follow, and then gets followed for about 15 minutes. Since the Brain Research Initiative began in 2013, NIH and the Brain Research Initiative are responsible for further researches on a variety of different brain circuits. The BRAIN Initiative, is a collaborative, public-private research initiative announced by the Obama administration with the goal of supporting the development and application of innovative technologies that can create a dynamic understanding of brain function.</div>

<div class='title'>a Computational Approach to Estimation of Crowding in Natural Images</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/lauri_ahonen">Lauri Ahonen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Crowding is a phenomenon where the identification of objects in peripheral vision is deteriorated by the presence of nearby targets. Crowding therefore reduces the extent of visual span, i.e. information intake during a single eye fixation. It is, thus, a limiting factor of many everyday tasks, such as reading. The phenomenon is due to wide area feature integration in the higher levels of visual processing. Despite the critical role of the phenomenon, complex natural images have so far not been used in the research of crowding. The purpose of the present study was to determine how the crowding effect affects object recognition in complex natural images, and whether the magnitude of the crowding could be modelled using methods introduced below. The actual magnitude of the crowding effect was determined experimentally by measuring contrast thresholds for letter targets of different sizes on various natural image backgrounds. The results of the experiments were analyzed to evaluate the developed methods. The methods are based on image statistics and clutter modelling. Clutter models assess the complexity in the image. The image statistics and the clutter models were combined with basic knowledge of the crowding effect. In addition, an early visual system model was incorporated to assess the role of the visual acuity across the visual field. The developed models predicted the induced crowding effect in an arbitrary natural image. The model of the visual system contributed to the results, as well. The differences between the methods for assessing the image properties were, however, negligible. Contrast energy, the simplest measure, can be regarded as the most efficient. Natural images can cause very strong crowding effects. The conclusion is that predicting quantitative dimensions of the crowding effect in an arbitrary image is viable. However further research of the subject is necessary for developing the models. Computational assessment of the crowding effect potentially can be applied to e.g. user interface design, assessing information visualization techniques, and the development of augmented reality applications.</div>

<div class='abstract'>The present scientific paradigm holds that the brain is the seat of consciousness, and a complete knowledge of the neurons will yield a full understanding of this phenomena.

<div class='title'>Information Compression as a Unifying Principle in Human Learning, Perception, and Cognition</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/j_gerard_wolff">J Gerard Wolff</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This paper reviews evidence for the idea that much of human learning, perception, and cognition, may be understood as information compression, and often more specifically as 'information compression via the matching and unification of patterns' (ICMUP). Evidence includes: information compression can mean selective advantage for any creature; the storage and utilisation of the relatively enormous quantities of sensory information would be made easier if the redundancy of incoming information were to be reduced; content words in natural languages, with their meanings, may be seen as ICMUP; other techniques for compression of information -- such as class-inclusion hierarchies, schema-plus-correction, run-length coding, and part-whole hierarchies -- may be seen in psychological phenomena; ICMUP may be seen in how we merge multiple views to make one, in recognition, in binocular vision, in how we can abstract object concepts via motion, in adaptation of sensory units in the eye of Limulus, the horseshoe crab, and in other examples of adaptation; the discovery of the segmental structure of language (words and phrases), grammatical inference, and the correction of over- and under-generalisations in learning, may be understood in terms of ICMUP; information compression may be seen in the perceptual constancies; there is indirect evidence for ICMUP in human cognition via kinds of redundancy such as the decimal expansion of Pi which are difficult for people to detect; much of the structure and workings of mathematics -- an aid to human thinking -- may be understood in terms of ICMUP; and there is additional evidence via the SP Theory of Intelligence and its realisation in the SP Computer Model. Three objections to the main thesis of this paper are described, with suggested answers. These ideas may be seen to be part of a 'Big Picture' with six components, outlined in the paper.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/janko_kokosar">Janko Kokosar</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The author is developing the idea that genes were not enough in evolution to create goals, because the first goals should have arisen quickly. This is another clue that consciousness exists also at unicellular organisms. Besides, qualia are more primitive form of a goal. Consciousness is composed of qualia and free-will, and both need new physics. Free-will is based also on quantum consciousness. Although it seems that it is disproved by Tegmark, it is very obvious, thus it cannot be disproved until it will not be clarified what a physical base of consciousness is. Quantum consciousness is based also on panpsychism, which has already some support in mainstream science. Explanations of goal, free-will, qualia, and consciousness are also things of explanation of time. It is shown how time is connected with matter and how with consciousness. At the end it is criticized, how official science too much ignores goals and ideas of authors that do not belong to it.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This work is based on modification of the general relativity, which includes effects of production /absorption of matter by the vacuum. The theory (without fitting parameters) is in good quantitative agreement with cosmological observations. In this theory we got an interface between dark and ordinary matter, which very likely exist not only in cosmos, but everywhere, including our body and, especially, our brain. Subjective experiences are considered as a manifestation of that interface. This opens a possibility of a &quot;communication&quot; with dark matter. Probable applications of these ideas include health (brain stimulation), communication, computational capabilities and energy resources.</div>

<div class='title'>Exposure of Charged Particle Beam on the Brain of the Humans Leads to a Painless Death</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/peiman_ghasemi">Peiman Ghasemi</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>By the progress of technology, following to advancements on directed energy systems and magnetic resonance, over an introductory research on potentials of application of charged particle beam on the brain of the humans which can lead to a painless consecutive death, we shall investigate for the possibility of prevention of the extreme pain that a volunteer patient may highly suffer of, before the death as a state for relieving the pain itself. Exposure of charged particle beam on the brain of the humans, potentially, leads to a painless death. The basal ganglia, S1 and BA3, S2, BA46, BA10, BA9, BA5, the pretectal area, the hippocampus (and the other parts of the limbic system), and the thalamus are the most important locations in the human&#8217;s brain, and targeting them destroys the home of our personality and the control/attention center of the brain, over NDE (near-death experience) it leads to finishing the life process of a patient who is suffering intolerable pain, but the patient won&#8217;t sense the pain ever. In conclusion, distinct parts of the cerebrum and the thalamus are active locations of self-personality and attention. In elder patients of extreme pain who suffer of untreatable illnesses, it may get considered voluntary as a final decision by the victim and the victim&#8217;s relatives. Thus, this experiment has several potentials for application; more research must be conducted with regard to in-depth understanding of these neural networks.</div>

<div class='abstract'>There is a book about psychedelics titled as &quot;Inner paths to outer space: Journies to Alien Worlds through Psychedelics and Other Spiritual Technics&quot; written by Rick Strassman, Slawek Wojtowicz, Luis Eduardo Luna and Ede Frecska. The basic message of the book is that psychedelics might make possible instantaneous remote communications with distant parts of the Universe. The basic objection is that light velocity sets stringent limits on classical communications. In TGD framework this argument does not apply. In the article a model for remote mental interactions is constructed using basic notions of TGD inspired quantum biology such as magnetic body, dark photons, and Zero Energy Ontology.</div>

<div class='title'>Geometric Theory of Harmony</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/m_pitkanen">M. Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In the earlier article I introduced the notion of Hamiltonian cycle as a mathematical model for musical harmony and also proposed a connection with biology: motivations came from two observations. The number of icosahedral vertices is 12 and corresponds to the number of notes in 12-note system and the number of triangular faces of icosahedron is 20, the number of aminoacids. This led to a group theoretical model of genetic code and replacement of icosahedron with tetraicosahedron to explain also the 21st and 22nd amino-acid and solve the problem of simplest model due to the fact that the required Hamilton's cycle does not exist. This led also to the notion of bioharmony. This article was meant to be a continuation to the mentioned article providing a proposal for a theory of harmony and detailed calculations. It however turned out that the proposed notion of bioharmony was too restricted: all icosahedral Hamilton cycles with symmetries turned out to be possible rather than only the 3 cycles forced by the assumption that the polarity characteristics of the amino-acids correlate with the properties of the Hamiltonian cycle. In particular, it turned out that the symmetries of the Hamiltonian cycles are the icosahedral symmetries needed to predict the basic numbers of the genetic code and its extension to include also 21st and 22nd aminoacids. One also ends up with a proposal for what harmony is leading to non-trivial predictions both at DNA and amino-acid level.</div>

<div class='title'>Toward a Theory of Consciousness</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/casper_spanggaard">Casper Spanggaard</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>More effort is needed to arrive at a complete theory of consciousness that provide a satisfactory explanation of conscious experience. Some considerations that may inspire and contribute to such a theory are described. The hypothesis that consciousness can result in evolutionary advantages only as a consequence of its participation in and its effects on decision making is considered. The hypotheses that consciousness is an intrinsic property of reality and that encoded information gives rise to a unique conscious experience is considered as well as if evolutionary processes shape the consciousness/system interface, and an abstract information-based reality. It is suggested that implementation of the non-event-based conscious decision making strategy may be the only possibility of creating artificial intelligent systems that have free will.</div>

<div class='title'>What is EEG made of?</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>A model for EEG as a communication tool of magnetic body is developed. The basic assumption is that communications from cell membrane occur by Josephson radiation inducing the analogs of cyclotron transitions: this leads to resonance conditions forcing the Josephson frequencies to be equal to cyclotron frequencies in the simplest situation. Music metaphor - in particular the metaphor &quot;right brain sings, left brain&quot; talks allows to further develop the earlier model. One must generalize the original assumption concerning the allowed values of magnetic field $B_{end}$ at flux tubes of the magnetic body: this generalization was forced already by the quantum model of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The model leads to a detailed identification of sub-bands of EEG in terms of cyclotron frequencies assignable to bosonic ions. One can understand the basic features of various EEG bands, why conscious experiences possible occurring during sleep are not remembered and the four stages of sleep, why beta amplitudes are low and tend to be chaotic, the origin of resonance frequencies of EEG. Also a model for how Schumann resonances could affect consciousness emerges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Music metaphor allows to develop in more detail the earlier proposal that nerve pulse patterns defined a languages with &quot;phonemes&quot; having duration of .1 seconds and obeying genetic code with 6 bits. Also the right brain signs metaphor can be given a detailed quantitative content in terms of the analog of music scale associated with the resting potential.</div>

<div class='title'>Negentropic Entanglement, NMP, Bariding and Topological Quantum Computation</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Negentropic entanglement for which number theoretic entropy characterized by p-adic prime is negative so that entanglement carries information, is in key role in TGD inspired theory of consciousness and quantum biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt; The key feature of negentropic entanglement is that density matrix is proportional to unit matrix so that the assumption that state function reduction corresponds to the measurement of density matrix does not imply state function reduction to one-dimensional sub-space. This special kind of degenerate density matrix emerges naturally for the hierarchy h&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;=nh interpreted in terms of a hierarchy of dark matter phases. I have already earlier considered explicit realizations of negentropic entanglement assuming that E is invariant under the group of unitary or orthogonal transformations (also subgroups of unitary group can be considered - say symplectic group). One can however consider much more general options and this leads to a connection with topological quantum computation (TQC). &lt;LI&gt; Entanglement matrix E equal to 1/n&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; factor times unitary matrix U (as a special case orthogonal matrix O) defines a density matrix given by &rho;=UU&lt;sup&gt;&dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;/n= Id&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/n, which is group invariant. One has NE respected by state function reduction if NMP is assumed. This would give huge number of negentropically entangled states providing a representation for some unitary group or its subgroup (such as symplectic group). In principle any unitary representation of any Lie group would allow representation in terms of NE. In principle any unitary representation of any Lie group would allow a representation in terms of NE. &lt;LI&gt; In physics as generalized number theory vision, a natural condition is that the matrix elements of E belong to the algebraic extension of p-adic numbers used so that discreted algebraic subgroups of unitary or orthogonal group are selected. This realizes evolutionary hierarchy as a hierarchy of p-adic number fields and their algebraic extensions, and one can imagine that evolution of cognition proceeds by the generation of negentropically entangled systems with increasing algebraic dimensions and increasing dimension reflecting itself as an increase of the largest prime power dividing n and defining the p-adic prime in question. &lt;LI&gt; One fascinating implication is the ability of TGD Universe to emulate itself like Turing machine: unitary S-matrix codes for scattering amplitudes and therefore for physics and negentropically entangled subsystem could represent sub-matrix for S-matrix as rules representing &quot;the laws of physics&quot; in the approximation that the world corresponds to n-dimension Hilbert space. Also the limit n&rarr; &infin; makes sense, especially so in the p-adic context where real infinity can correspond to finite number in the sense of p-adic norm. Here also dimensions n given as products of powers of infinite primes can be formally considered. &lt;/OL&gt;</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>t the 12-note scale could allow mapping to a closed path covering all vertices of icosahedron having 12 vertices and not intersecting itself is attractive. Also the idea that the triangles defining the faces of the icosahedron could have interpretation as 3-chords defining the notion of harmony for a given chord deserves study. The paths in question are known as Hamiltonian cycles and there are 1024 of them. There paths can be classified topologically by the numbers of triangles containing 0, 1, or 2 edges belonging to the cycle representing the scale. Each topology corresponds to particular notion of harmony and there are several topological equivalence classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have also played with the idea that the 20 amino-acids could somehow correspond to the 20 triangles of icosahedron. The combination of this idea with the idea of mapping 12-tone scale to a Hamiltonian cycle at icosahedron leads to the question whether amino-acids could be assigned with a topological equivalence class of Hamiltonian cycle and whether topological characteristics could correspond to physical properties of amino-acids. It turns out that the identification of 3 basic polar amino-acids with triangles containing no edges of the scale path, 7 polar and acidic polar amino-acids with those containing 2 edges of the scale path, and 10 non-polar amino-acids with triangles containing 1 edge on the scale path would be consistent with the constraints on the Hamiltonian cycles. One could of course criticize the lumping of acidic polar and polar aminoacids to same group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of DNAs coding for a given amino-acid could be also seen as such a physical property. The model for dark nucleons leads to the vertebrate genetic code with correct numbers of DNAs coding for amino-acids. It is however far from clear how to interpreted DNAs geometrically and the problem whether one cold understand genetic code geometrically remains open.</div>

<div class='title'>Comparison of TGD Inspired Theory of Consciousness with Some Other Theories of Consciousness</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This work has been inspired by two books. The first book &quot;On intelligence&quot; is by Jeff Hawkins. The second book &quot;Consciousness: the science of subjectivity&quot; is by Antti Revonsuo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeff Hawkins has developed a highly interesting and inspiring vision about neo-cortex, one of the few serious attempts to build a unified view about what brain does and how it does it. Since key ideas of Hawkins have quantum analogs in TGD framework, there is high motivation for developing a quantum variant of this vision. The vision of Hawkins is very general in the sense that all parts of neo-cortex would run the same fundamental algorithm, which is essentially checking whether the sensory input can be interpreted in terms of standard mental images stored as memories. This process occurs at several abstraction levels and involve massive feedback. If it succeeds at all these levels the sensory input is fully understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TGD suggests a generalization of this process. Quantum jump defining moment of consciousness would be the fundamental algorithm realized in all scales defining an abstraction hierarchy. Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) would be the variational principle driving this process and in optimal case lead to an experience of understanding at all levels of the scale hierarchy realized in terms of generation of negentropic entanglement. The analogy of NMP with second law suggests strongly thermodynamical analogy and p-adic thermodynamics used in particle mass calculations might be also seen as effective thermodynamics assignable to NMP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the following I will first discuss the ideas of Hawkins and then summarize some relevant aspects of quantum TGD and TGD inspired theory of consciousness briefly in the hope that this could make representation comprehensible for the reader having no background in TGD (I hope I have achieved this). The representation involves some new elements: reduction of the old idea about motor action as time reversal of sensory perception to the anatomy of quantum jump in zero energy ontology (ZEO); interaction free measurement for photons and photons as a non-destructive reading mechanism of memories and future plans (time reversed memories) represented 4-dimensionally as negentropically entangled states approximately invariant under quantum jumps (this resolves a basic objection against identifying quantum jump as moment of consciousness) leading to the identification of analogs of imagination and internal speech as fundamental elements of cognition; and a more detailed quantum model for association and abstraction processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I will also compare various theories and philosophies of consciousness with TGD approach following the beautifully organized representation of Revonsuo. Also anomalies of consciousness are briefly discussed. My hope is that this comparison would make explicit that TGD based ontology of consciousness indeed circumvents the difficulties against monistic and dualistic approaches and also survives the basic objections that I have been able to invent hitherto.</div>

<div class='title'>Hypnosis as Remote Mental Interaction</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In TGD framework one can argue that hypnosis represents an example about the fact that brain is not &quot;private property&quot;: hypnotist uses the biological body and brain of the subject as instrument. Therefore remote mental interaction is in question. This idea generalizes: if one accepts self hierarchy, one can assign to any kind of higher level structure - family, organization, species, .... - a higher level self and magnetic body carrying dark matter, and these magnetic bodies can use lower level magnetic bodies as their instruments to realize their intentions. Biological bodies would be an important level in the hierarchy, which would continue down to cellular, molecular, and perhaps to even lower levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This view challenges the prevailing views about brain as a sole seat of consciousness and the assumption that conscious entities assigned with brains are completely isolated. Given magnetic body can use several biological bodies although one can assign to it the one providing the sensory input - at least during wake-up state. Note however that it is easy to produce illusion that some foreign object is part of biological body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more than decade ago I proposed a model for so called bicamerality based on the notion of semitrance. In semitrance the brain of subject becomes partially entangled with a higher level self - in this case the self of family or more general social group uses the biological body of member for its purposes. Higher level self gives its commands and advice interpreted by the bicameral as &quot;God's voice&quot;. The consciousness of schizophrenic might be basically bicameral. Also hypnotic state and dream consciousness are candidates for bicameral consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this article I develop essentially this idea but using as input the recent understanding of about TGD inspired theory of consciousness and quantum biology and end up with a proposal for a detailed mechanism for how the magnetic body hijacks some parts of the brain of the subject: prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex are argued to be the most plausible targets of hijacking. Also a mechanism explaining how the sensory hallucinations and motor actions are induced by hypnotist by inhibiting a halting mechanism preventing imagined motor actions to become real and sensory imagination to become &quot;qualiafied&quot;.</div>

<div class='title'>About Concrete Realization of Remote Metabolism</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The idea of &quot;remote metabolism&quot; (or quantum credit card, as I have also called it) emerged more than a decade ago - and zero energy ontology (ZEO) provides the justification for it. The idea is that the system needing energy sends negative energy to a system able to receive the negative energy and make a transition to a lower energy state. This kind of mechanism would be ideal for biology, where rapid reactions to a changing environment are essential for survival. Originally this article was intended to summarize a more detailed model of remote metabolism but the article expanded to a considerably more detailed view about TGD inspired biology than the earlier vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is shown that the basic notions of the theory of Ling about cell metabolism inspired by various anomalies have natural counterparts in TGD based model relying on the notion of magnetic body. Remote metabolism can be considered as a universal metabolic mechanism with magnetic body of ATP, or system containing it, carrying the metabolic energy required by the biological user. In particular, the role of ATP is discussed in Ling's theory and from the point of view of TGD-inspired theory of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is easy to imagine new technologies relying on negative energy signals propagating to the geometric past and ZEO justifies these speculations. Remote metabolism could make possible a new kind of energy technology. The discoveries of Tesla made more than a century ago plus various free energy anomalies provide excellent material for developing these ideas, and one ends up with a concrete proposal for how dark photons and dark matter could be produced in capacitor-like systems analogous to cell membranes and acting as Josephson junctions and how energy could be extracted from &quot;large&quot; magnetic bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The model identifies Josephson frequency with the subharmonic of the frequency characterizing the periodicity of a periodic voltage perturbation assumed to correspond to cyclotron frequency in biological applications. Together with quantization conditions for charge and effective Planck constant it leads to precise quantitative predictions for capacitor-like systems acting as dark capacitors. Also a relationship between the magnetic field at the magnetic body of the system and the voltage of the capacitor-like Josephson junction emerges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The predictions allow new quantitative insights about biological evolution as emergence of Josephson junctions realized as capacitor-like systems both at the level of cell, DNA and proteins, and brain. h&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; can be related to Josephson frequency and cyclotron frequency and thus to measurable parameters. h&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; serves as a kind of intelligence quotient and its maximization requires the maximization of both the voltage and area of the membrane-like capacitor system involved. This is what has happened during evolution. Indeed, the internal cell membranes, cortical layers and DNA double strand in chromosomes are strongly folded, and the value of membrane electric field is roughly twice the value of the electric field for which di-electric breakdown occurs in air. Even 40 Hz thalamocortical resonance frequency can be understood in the framework of the model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The claimed properties of Tesla's &quot;cold electricity&quot; strongly suggest interpretation in terms of dark matter in TGD sense. This leads to a proposal that a transition to dark phase occurs when the value of voltage equals the rest mass of charged particle involved. This criterion generalizes to the case of cell membrane and relates the values of h&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;, p-adic prime p, and threshold potential for various charged particles to each other. The idea that nerve pulse corresponds to the breakdown of super-conductivity as a transition from dark to ordinary phase receives additional support. The resulting picture conforms surprisingly well with the earlier speculations involving dark matter and p-adically scaled variants of weak and color interactions in biologically relevant length scales. An extremely simple mechanism producing ATP involving only the kicking of two protonic Cooper pairs through the cell membrane by Josephson photon as a basic step is proposed. Also the proposal that neutrino Cooper pairs could be highly relevant not only for cognition and but also metabolism finds support.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Michael Persinger's group reports three very interesting experimental findings related to EEG, magnetic fields, photon emissions from brain, and macroscopic quantum coherence. The findings provide also support for the proposal of Hu and Wu that nerve pulse activity could induce spin flips of spin networks assignable to cell membrane. In this article I analyze the experiments from TGD point of view. It turns out that the experiments provide support for several TGD inspired ideas about living matter. Magnetic flux quanta as generators of macroscopic quantum entanglement, dark matter as a hierarchy of macroscopic quantum phases with large effective Planck constant, DNA-cell membrane system as a topological quantum computer with nucleotides and lipids connected by magnetic flux tubes with ends assignable to phosphate containing molecules, and the proposal that &quot;dark&quot; nuclei consisting of dark proton strings could provide a representation of the genetic code. The proposal of Hu and Wu translates to the assumption that lipids of the two layers of the cell membrane are accompanied by dark protons which arrange themselves to dark protonic strings defining a dark analog of DNA double strand.</div>

<div class='title'>Two Attempts to Understand PK</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/m_pitkanen">M. Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The question how intentional action is concretely realized is not only a key question in quantum consciousness theory but also in attempts to understand psychokinesis (PK). In TGD framework the mechanisms of intentional action and PK are basically the same, and the article can be seen also as a proposal for how intentional action might be realized in TGD Universe. There are experimental results - such as the experiments of Libet - suggesting that intentional action involves a signal propagating to geometric past where it initiates the desired action. PK experiments with random bit sequences suggest a model based on state function reduction, and the possibility to affect intentionally the probabilities of the outcomes of the microscopic quantum transition with two final states representing the values of bits. The standard view is that the intentional action interferes directly with the microscopic quantum transition. &quot;Too-good-to-be-true&quot; option is that intentional action is able to produce a quantum superposition of bits represented as magnetized regions. In this case a direct experimental proof of PK by comparing the data file subject to intentional action with its copy - and thus involving no statistical procedures - is possible. A detailed mechanism allowing the observer (either operator or experimenter) to affect by intentional action the number of 1s or 0s in a series of bits stored in a data file as magnetized regions is discussed.</div>

This conception stems from the self-referential construction of spacetime through torsion fields and its singularities; in particular the photon's self-referential character, basic to the embodiment of cognition ; we shall elaborate this in detail in perception and neurology. We discuss the relations between this embodiment, bio-photons and wave genetics, and the relation with the enactive approach in cognitive sciences due to Varela.

We introduce a mathematical-physics and philosophical theory for the physical realm and its mapping to the cognitive and perceptual realms and a philosophical reflection on the bearings of this fusion in cosmology, cognitive sciences, human and natural systems and its relations with a time operator and the existence of time cycles in Nature's and human systems. This conception surges from the self-referential construction of spacetime through torsion fields and its singularities; in particular the photon's self-referential character, basic to the embodiment of cognition ; we shall elaborate this in detail in perception and neurology.</div>

<div class='title'>TGD and EEG</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The TGD based general view about EEG developed in this book relies on the following general picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Magnetic body is the key actor in TGD inspired model of EEG and nerve pulse. Magnetic body acts as intentional agent using biological body as motor instrument and sensory receptor. There would be entire hierarchy of magnetic bodies associated with various body parts and characterized by the p-adic length scale and the level of dark matter hierarchy labeled by the value of Planck constant. The hierarchy of counterparts of EEGs associated with photons, Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and W bosons, and gluons at various frequency scales involving dark bosons with energies above thermal threshold by the large value of hbar would make possible communication and control. In particular, cyclotron radiation from Bose-Einstein condensates at magnetic body and Josephson radiation from Josephson junctions associated with cell membrane and other bio-electrets would be involved and cyclotron and Josephson frequencies would correspond to EEG frequencies. &lt;LI&gt; DNA as topological quantum computer vision suggests a rather detailed view about how genome and cell membrane interact. Nucleotides and lipids would be connected by magnetic flux tubes carrying dark matter with varying values of Planck constant and define braiding affected by the 2-D flow of the lipids in liquid crystal state and giving rise to a topological quantum computation with program modules defined by liquid flow patterns resulting via self organization process in presence of metabolic energy feed. &lt;LI&gt; Sensory qualia could be associated with the generalized di-electric breakdowns between sensory organ and its magnetic body. The cyclotron phase transitions of Bose-Einstein condensates of biologically important ions generated by the dark EEG photons at the magnetic body could generate the analogs of somatosensory qualia identifiable as our cognitive and emotional qualia. Long ranged charge entanglement made possible by W MEs (topological light rays) could be essential element of motor control and generate exotic ionization of nuclei (new nuclear physics predicted by TGD) in turn inducing classical electric fields at space-time sheets carrying ordinary matter. These fields generate various responses such as ionic waves and nerve pulses yielding the desired physiological responses. The recent view about cell membrane as almost vacuum extremal of K&amp;auml;hler action explains large parity breaking effects in living matter and also the peak frequencies of photoreceptors in retina. Also a model for the cell membrane as a kind of sensory homunculus with lipids identified as pixels of a sensory map representing basic qualia follows naturally. Furthermore, EEG photons and biophotons can be identified as decay products of same dark photons. &lt;/OL&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan of the book is roughly following. The chapter describing the magnetic sensory canvas hypothesis is followed by a model for nerve pulse and by three chapters devoted to EEG.</div>

<div class='title'>TGD Inspired Theory of Consciousness</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This book tries to give an overall view about TGD inspired theory of consciousness as it stands now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The basic notions TGD inspired theory of consciousness are quantum jump identified as a moment of consciousness, self identified as sequence of quantum jumps analogous to bound state of particles, self hierarchy with sub-selves experienced by self as mental images, and sharing and fusion of mental images by quantum entanglement. The topics of the book are organized in the following manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt; In the first part of the book TGD inspired theory of consciousness is discussed. There are three summarizing chapters giving a view about how ideas have evolved. There are also chapter about Negentropy Maximization Principle, about the notion of self, and about sensory representations. &lt;LI&gt; The second part of the book contains two chapters about the relationship between experienced and geometric time. The first one is more than decade old. The second one - inspired by zero energy ontology and written quite recently - provides a rather detailed vision about how the arrow of geometric time correlating with the arrow of experienced time and the localization of the contents of sensory experience to a narrow time interval emerge. The chapter explaining TGD based view about long term memory is also included. &lt;LI&gt; The third part of the book summarizes roughly decade old view about intelligence and cognition. p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality and many-fermion states as representations of Boolean statements are the key notions. In zero energy ontology also quantal versions of logical rules A&amp;rarr; B realized as quantum variants of Boolean functions emerge at the fundamental level. A chapter about the role of dark matter hierarchy, in particular about topological quantum computation as a universal information processing tool, would be needed to make the picture more complete. &lt;LI&gt; The fourth chapter is devoted to remote mental interactions. The theoretical motivation for taking remote mental interactions seriously is that exactly the same mechanisms which are involved with the interaction between magnetic body and biological body apply also to remote mental interactions in TGD Universe. One could also understand why these phenomena are rare: a kind of immune system making it impossible for foreign magnetic bodies to control and communicate with the biological body possessed by a particular magnetic body would be a highly probable (but perhaps not unavoidable) outcome of evolutionary process. &lt;/OL&gt;</div>

<div class='title'>Mathematical Aspects of Consciousness Theory</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This book discusses general mathematical ideas behind TGD inspired theory of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;I&gt; PART I: New Physics And Mathematics Involved With TGD&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Clifford algebra associated with point of configuration space (&quot;world of classical worlds&quot;) decomposes to a direct integral of von Neumann algebras known as hyper-finite factors of type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This implies strong physical predictions and deep connections with conformal field theories, knot-, braid- and quantum groups, and topological quantum computation. &lt;br&gt; In TGD framework dark matter forms a hierarchy with levels characterized partially by the value of Planck constant labeling the pages of the book like structure formed by singular covering spaces of the imbedding space M&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times; CP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; glued together along four-dimensional back. Particles at different pages are dark relative to each other since purely local interactions (vertices of Feynman diagram) involve only particles at the same page. The phase transitions changing the value of Planck constant having interpretation as tunneling between different pages of the book would induce phase transitions of gel phases abundant in living matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;I&gt; Part II: TGD Universe as topological quantum computer&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The braids formed by magnetic flux tubes are ideal for the realization of topological quantum computations (tqc). Bio-systems are basic candidates for topological quantum computers. In DNA as tqc vision nucleotides and lipids are connected by flux tubes and the flow of lipids induces tqc programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;I&gt; Part III: Categories, Number Theory And Consciousness&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Category theory could reflect the basic structures of conscious thought. The comparison of the inherent generalized logics associated with categories to the Boolean logic naturally associated with the configuration space spinor fields is also of interest. &lt;br&gt; The notion of infinite prime was the first mathematical invention inspired by TGD inspired theory of consciousness. The construction of infinite primes is very much analogous to a repeated second quantization of a super-symmetric arithmetic quantum field theory (with analogs of bound states included). Infinite primes form an infinite hierarchy and the physical realization of this hierarchy imply infinite hierarchy of conscious entities and that we represent only a single level in this hierarchy looking infinitesimal from the point of view of higher levels. The notion of infinite rational predicts an infinite number of real units with infinitely rich number theoretical anatomy and single space-time point becomes a Platonia able to represent every quantum state of the entire Universe in its structure: kind of algebraic Brahman=Atman identity.</div>

<div class='title'>Magnetospheric Consciousness</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>This book is about the notion of magnetic body, which is one of the key notions in TGD inspired model of living matter and predicts a hierarchy of generalized EEGs associated with the magnetic bodies responsible for communication and control. Not only personal magnetic bodies of living systems need to be relevant and the idea about entire magnetosphere as a conscious system controlling the behavior of biosphere emerges naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt; Part I discusses the idea about magnetosphere as a fractally scaled up version of biological body and brain. p-Adic fractality and dark matter hierarchy give some plausibility to this idea. Also a vision about evolution in many-sheeted space-time is discussed. &lt;LI&gt; Part II introduces the notion of semitrance involving quantum entanglement of subself of self, say subsystem of brain, with remote system. The entanglement of sub-systems of two unentangled systems possible in many-sheeted space-time means sharing and fusion of mental images (say stereo vision). The notion of finite measurement resolution justifies this concept.&lt;br&gt; Semitrance could have been basic control and communication tool of collective levels of consciousness during the period of human consciousness which Jaynes calls bicamerality. The idea that human consciousness might have had totally different character for only few millenia ago, finds additional support from the notions of super- and hyper genome implicated naturally by the dark matter hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body. The identification of memes as hyper-genes looks attractive. The evolution of hyper-genome could have driven the explosive evolution of human civilizations during last two millenia. &lt;LI&gt; Part III entitled &quot;Crazy Stuff&quot; discusses the idea that crop circles are due to intentional action of magnetospheric higher level self or a higher level self using magnetosphere as a tool to build them. Two special crop circles, Chilbolton and Crabwood crop circles, are discussed. The proposal is that they provide information about the genomes of life forms responsible for them. The most science fictive identification for these life-forms would be ourselves in distant geometric future using time mirror mechanism to affect geometric past. &lt;/OL&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the material of this book has been written much before the dark matter revolution and formulation of the zero energy ontology and that I have only later added comments to the existing text. I hope that I can later add new material in which the implications of the dark matter hierarchy are discussed in more detail.</div>

<div class='title'>Bio-Systems as Conscious Holograms</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/matti_pitkanen">Matti Pitk&#228;nen</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>Brain as a hologram is an old idea and it emerges naturally also in TGD framework both at quantum and classical level, which by quantum classical correspondence is expected to reflect what happens at the deeper quantum level. The book is organized as follows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt; The new view about the relationship between experienced and geometric time underlies the notion of 4-D dynamical hologram. Therefore the first part of the book contains three chapters about this topic reflecting the development of ideas. The first one is more than decade old. The third one written quite recently is inspired by zero energy ontology and provides a rather detailed vision about how the arrow of geometric time correlating with the arrow of experienced time and the localization of the contents of sensory experience to a narrow time interval emerge. It must be emphasized that the details of the model for the relationship between experienced and geometric time are still uncertain. &lt;LI&gt; Second part of the book is devoted to the development of hologram idea. Also a general model of sensory qualia and a model for sensory receptor as electret, which are very abundant in living matter, are discussed. The recent view about cell membrane as almost vacuum extremal of K&amp;auml;hler action explains large parity breaking effects in living matter and also the peak frequencies of photoreceptors in retina. Also a model for the cell membrane as a kind of sensory homunculus with lipids identified as pixels of a sensory map representing basic qualia follows naturally. Furthermore, EEG photons and biophotons can be identified as decay products of same dark photons. &lt;LI&gt; The third part of the book is devoted to water memory and metabolism. The title suggests a connection between these two and this kind of connection has indeed emerged. A discovery - certainly one of the greatest surprises of my professional life - popped up as an outcome of an attempt to understand the mechanism behind water memory for which rather strong support exists now. The idea was that dark nuclei which sizes zoomed up to atomic size scale could provide a representation of genes with dark nucleons consisting of three quarks representing DNA codons. It turned out that the model for dark nucleon consisting of three quarks predicts counterparts of 64 DNAs, 64 RNAs, and 20 aminoacids and allows to identify vertebrate genetic code as a natural mapping of DNA type states to amino-acid type states. The population of dark nuclei would be new life-form possibly responsible for the water memory. The chapter about metabolism represents a model of metabolism based on the identification of universal metabolic energy quanta as increments of zero point kinetic energies emitted or absorbed as particles are transferred between space-time time sheets characterized by different p-adic primes. &lt;/OL&gt;</div>
