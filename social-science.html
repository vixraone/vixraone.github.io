<div class='abstract'>In this note, we give a proof for a lower bound (though not a satisfying one) of the density of minimal dividing odd subsets where the goldenratio surprisingly appears. We also provide some other properties of such integer subsets and some new insight on the relationship between minimaldividing odd subsets and the Goldbach conjecture. We argue that the study of minimal dividing odd subsets is a new and interesting starting point to prove the Goldbach conjecture.</div>

<div class='title'>Analysis of the 2021 Instant Run-Off Elections in Utah</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/jiri_navratil">Jiri Navratil</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/warren_d_smith">Warren D. Smith</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We analyzed the 2021 Ranked Choice Voting elections in Utah County and Moab (the capitol of Grand County), focusing on the Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) algorithm. We found three issues: (1) The fractions of ballots discarded and those that needed rectification exceeded 10% in 7 of the 17 races (across 4 municipalities) indicating a considerable degree of voter confusion .(2) Four different election pathologies were detected in the Council (Seat 1) race in Moab: failure to elect a consensus winner, monotonicity failure and two participation failures. A ``spoiler'' candidate, which IRV proponents have claimed this method prevents, was also detected.(3) Four towns elected two seats by discarding the winner of the first seat, then re-running IRV with the resulting modified ballots to determine the winner of the second seat. This all four times caused the second-place finisher in the first election, not to win the 2nd seat, but rather to finish second again, somewhat frustratingly for them.Overall, IRV elected the same winner as standard plurality in 15 of 16 races with &gt;= 3 candidates, with the single changed outcome in the Vineyard City Council (Seat 2) race.We also analyzed the data from a recount viewpoint -- implementing the Utah Election Code rules for automatic recounts versus Blom et al. ``Exact Margin of Victory (EMOV)'' method. According to the former, a recount was justified in two races, namely the Springville (4yr) and Moab City Councils; butonly Moab was actually recounted. However, EMOV showed recounting Springville almost certainly would have been inconsequential. As far as we know, this is the first-of-kind analysis of IRV elections in the state of Utah and it highlights the paradoxical properties of the IRV algorithm --- often incorrectly dismissed as too rare to worry about --- showing that these unfortunately indeed occur in real-world elections hence really are worrisome. In conjunction with the above-mentioned ballot issues, these problems cast doubt on the wisdom of IRV for Utah. We believe there are better alternatives than IRV, e.g. ``range voting,'' and these should become part of a debate towards fundamentally rethinking the program.</div>

<div class='abstract'>This article analyzes the nature, influencing factors, and countermeasures of love killings, and proposes that love killings are extreme incidents of killing because of emotional conflicts and entanglements. The emotional disputes are divided into four types: breakup disputes, love rival disputes, emotional infidelity, and courtship rejection. kind. The author tried to explore the psychological factors related to the occurrence of love killings: social rejection, frustration, stress, self-esteem, parental rearing styles, and psychological flexibility. Based on the above factors, the author quoted Fromm's views on love to explain what mature love is, and proposed that in order to avoid more love killings, it is advocated to improve the psychological flexibility of individuals, and to know how to identify and stay away from dangerous lovers in time.</div>

<div class='title'>An Introduction to the Relearning Cycle Index $i_{rel}$ and the Average Split Function $\bar{f}_{rel}$ of the Source Energy Exploitation by and for the Neural Networks.</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/alexis_zaganidis">Alexis Zaganidis</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>We define the relearning cycle index $i_{ReL}$ and the average split function $\bar{f}_{ReL}$ of the source energy exploitation by and for the neural networks. We propose an optimized learning strategy which depend on a fixed relearning cycle index $i_{ReL}$ and a fixed average split function $\bar{f}_{ReL}$. In practice, this theory may explain why the communist politics in Russia and in China faced strong difficulties at the 20th century and why the private companies politics in Western countries faced critical difficulties at the beginning of the 21th century. We conclude with some critical hints for the future relearning cycles of the source energy exploitation by and for the neural networks.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In the article &quot;The introduction of the Einstein Model of a Solid, to Analytical Psychology&quot;, I documented that from an economic point of view, the psyche as defined in Analytical Psychology (AP), can be considered an abstract Einstein Solid (ES). &lt;p&gt; In this article, I examine the case of an interacting ES (grand canonical ensemble) and the results of this interaction in its Information content. I consider fluctuations in the number of the quantum harmonic oscillators (or Structures of the psyche in AP) and energy quanta (or Values in AP). For fluctuations, the microcanonical and grand canonical ensemble are considered equivalent. This means that we are allowed to examine the psyche both in isolation (as originally identified with the ES) and also as an open system accepting fluctuations in its core elements.</div>

<div class='abstract'>I try to show in this brief note a simple case of the use of science with ideological, political or sectarian interests by those who, having prejudices, say they love and know it. \textit{That} case, is the case of Luk&#225;cs in his work on the criticism of irrationalism that emerges in the 18th and 19th century, in which he shows a deep scientific ignorance as well as a persistent and unpleasant defense of the ideology that he professes. If, someone, while affirming that science is valid knowledge using it in his speech, and his doctrine, advocates its use or considers science itself, burning the ship of demarcation, if, he maintains the recognized scientific methodology apart from his dogmas and arguments for being contrary to his creed and simultaneously \textit{ignoramus et ignorabimus} the essential of contemporary scientific knowledge, then, the result of his convictions and litanies, with the emphasis or insistence that others allow him, contributes absolutely nothing to the science and confuses the clueless.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Intellectual blindness for those who believe they have the fleece of legitimacy, is the fundamental reason for advising a rigorous, scientifically based epistemology of human relations, including, or exceedingly, those contained in political theories, whose object is mere superstition, as is known. Stirner's infrequent political position, individualistic or selfish anarchism, despite some of his accurate analyzes, does not avoid the same criticism; in essence, his plot adventures are empty statements, linguistic games, lack of clarity, the same idealistic dogmatism that constantly attacks, poetizes everywhere, and, even basing his cause on nothing, he forgets that he is a living being. Is that nothing?</div>

<div class='abstract'>In addition to the common difficulties in clarifying the basic concepts used in Rothbard's theory of the new freedom, there are those that this author strangely includes in the writing of his book, \textit{For a New Liberty. The Libertarian Manifesto}. These provoke in the reader the suspicion of encountering expressive rhetorical forms that Rothbard is unable to elucidate. In particular, when he deals with the concept of freedom and derivatives, which he sometimes uses and at other times he mentions as if the illumination of it in the aforementioned way leads to the assumption that one knows what the author is talking about or what the author is referring to. I wish to show that, despite Rothbard's insistence, his intellectual hope with his new concept of freedom is spurious and does not detect the setbacks that the environment poses to him.</div>

Some of these authors, like Hayek, seem to consider that they are exempt from the general emptiness to which they are logically subject by the mere expedient of supposing them endowed with social or political meaning, without taking into account that human characteristics are carried by a natural biological entity that evolves, like the rest, by means of natural selection.</div>

<div class='title'>The Hitchhikers' Guide to Reading and Writing Health Research</div>
<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/arindam_basu">Arindam Basu</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>In this paper, we introduce the concepts of critically reading research papers and writing of research proposals and reports. Research methods is a general term that includes the processes of observation of the world around the researcher, linking background knowledge with foreground questions, drafting a plan of collection of data and framing theories and hypotheses, testing the hypotheses, and finally, drafting or writing the research to evoke new knowledge. These processes vary with the themes and disciplines that the researcher engages in; nevertheless, common motifs can be found. In this paper, we propose three methods are interlinked: a deductive reasoning process where the structure of the thought can be captured critically; an inductive reasoning method where the researcher can appraise and generate generalisable ideas from observations of the world; and finally, abductive reasoning method where the world can be explained or the phenomena observed can be explained or be accounted for. This step or reasoning is also about framing theories, testing and challenging established knowledge or finding best theories and how theories best fit the observations. We start with a discussion of the different types of statements that one can come across in any scholarly literature or even in lay or semi-serious literature, appraise them, and identify arguments from non-arguments, and explanations from non-explanations. Then we outline three strategies to appraise and identify reasonings in explanations and arguments. We end with a discussion on how to draft a research proposal and a reading/archiving strategy of research.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Motivated by the seemingly chaotic state of affairs of contemporary world political actions, I describe a possible psychological masses domination strategy called &#8220;contradictory stimulation&#8221;. Assuming that there is the possibility of a genuine intention on the part of some families and powerful organizations in guiding humanity in the way of their interests, I point through mathematical and computational models that contradictory stimulation can be effective in inducing a subservient mentality in the political citizens.

<div class='abstract'>In this work, touched on some social issues whatever the result, and a raising awareness was aimed by some new technological upgrades for the vital infrastructures of states, social order and economic plans. The main aim is one world order which has no king and accepts nations as local governance as a requirement of hierarchical order. It is completely based on economic benefits of all nations as there is no alternative to establish a healthy economic order as economic management is directly related with laws. As the important is a law exists or not, or is just or not for justice, also it encourages to develop organic laws in state institutions as it recognizes any state institution as autonomous. No state has this constitution. This work is only an offer.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/sierra_rayne">Sierra Rayne</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/kaya_forest">Kaya Forest</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The concept of an &quot;oil curse&quot; has been widely debated in the literature. Two clear camps have emerged: (1) those that favor the basic hypothesis or a modified version thereof, and (2) those that find little generalizable empirical evidence for the negative impacts of oil and gas development on the political, socio-economic, and/or environmental trajectories of oil and gas producing nations relative to their non-oil and gas producing counterparts. Overall, we find no significant evidence to support a generalizable concept of an oil curse. In general, our results do not seek to dismiss concerns regarding the potential impacts of oil and gas development on some regions, but rather to illustrate that any such impacts do not appear to be universal in either their direction or magnitude. Similar to what other groups have found, we see evidence that - in some cases - increased oil and gas development appears to correlate with improved socio-economic indicators. In other cases, the evidence is ambiguous at best in light of the large numbers of confounding variables that are effectively impossible to rigorously account for in order to obtain clear and unequivocal negative causal mechanisms between oil and gas development and the status of a society.</div>

<div class='abstract'>In 2006, Friedman wrote an influential and widely cited article in Foreign Policy magazine [May/June (2006) 28-36] stating The First Law of Petropolitics. This law held that the quality of governance in oil-rich petrolist states is inversely correlated with a causative relationship from increasing oil prices. In contrast, we find no generally consistent governance patterns among oil-rich petrolist states related to the price of oil that support any claims for a First Law of Petropolitics.</div>

<div class='abstract'>Between 2007/2008 and 2012/2013, inflation adjusted undergraduate tuition fees for full-time Canadian students increased significantly in all disciplines. All disciplines except dentistry also exhibited substantial increases in inflation adjusted graduate tuition fees for full-time Canadian students over this period. In contrast to prior claims in the literature, we show that low tuition rates in the Canadian post-secondary system do not redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich. For each dollar of taxpayer derived financial support going into the Canadian college and university system, the wealthiest families paid almost the entire amount. Consequently, it appears that regardless of current or proposed tuition rates, the Canadian post-secondary system is a wealth transfer from the rich to the poor.</div>

<div class='author'><a href="https://vixra.org/author/sierra_rayne">Sierra Rayne</a>, <a href="https://vixra.org/author/kaya_forest">Kaya Forest</a></div>
<div class='abstract'>The Sinosphere is in ascension towards global economic dominance on both total and per capita bases, marking a fundamental shift in the balance of global economic and military power that is taking place absent any robust structural democratic and human rights reforms in this region. In contrast to comparisons during the 1980s of Japan potentially overtaking the United States as the world's largest economy, both purchasing power parity (PPP) and current United States dollar GDP metrics consistently project that China's gross domestic product (GDP) will exceed that of the United States sometime between 2015 and 2020. The Sinosphere's GDP-PPP passed that of The Commonwealth (including India) in 2011, The Commonwealth (excluding India) in 2005, the Francosphere member states in 2003, the Francosphere member and observer states in 2009 - subsequently widening the gap in all cases - and is predicted to surpass that of the Anglosphere by the early 2020s. China's military spending now exceeds that of all other nations bordering the East and South China Seas combined and the gap is widening rapidly. At current rates of increase, China's military expenditures may surpass those of the United States within the next decade. On a per capita basis, China's GDP-PPP is expected to overtake that of the United States and Canada by the early to mid-2030s, whereas Russia and the EU are projected to be surpassed by China in per capita GDP-PPP by the late 2020s.</div>
